1,"Anthony Bourdain: “There’s a guy inside me who wants to lay in bed, and smoke weed all day, and watch cartoons, and old movies. I could easily do that. My whole life is a series of stratagems to avoid, and outwit, that guy.”","Anthony Bourdain was a chef. He was an author. He was the host of his own cooking and travel TV show, Parts Unknown. In between those roles, he also juggled a number of other ventures in publishing, with Anthony Bourdain Books, films, and magazines – he was the sole investor and editor-at-large at culture & politics website Roads & Kingdoms.

When asked why he worked so much and rarely took a break, Bourdain explained that he was afraid of an “inner hippie” taking over his life. “I understand that free time is probably my enemy. That if I’m given too much free time to contemplate the mysteries of the universe, I’m afraid of that inner hippie emerging,” he told Men’s Journal.

“There’s a guy inside me who wants to lay in bed, and smoke weed all day, and watch cartoons, and old movies. I could easily do that. My whole life is a series of stratagems to avoid, and outwit, that guy.”

So, he worked. A lot. At a constant, frenetic pace. He told Maria Bustillos for a Popula interview that shortly after he finishes a big project – writing a book or filming a season of Parts Unknown – and he has a few weeks of free time, he’ll begin to panic and “start overcommitting to a lot of projects, maybe comfortably removed from that date but I do suddenly feel like: What do I do now?”

Filming Parts Unknown took up a majority of his time. The CNN show, which spanned 12 seasons from 2013 to 2018, featured Bourdain visiting off the beaten path spots around the world from a cultural and culinary perspective: revisiting the 1992 Los Angeles riots in Koreatown, dining with locals in Punjab, discussing politics in Istanbul, exploring Okinawa’s history, sharing a beer with President Barack Obama in Hanoi, Vietnam and many more.

Though Bourdain was on the road for over 250 days a year, he had a few set rules to ensure some sort of work-life balance. He never filmed two destinations back to back, and reserved five days a month to spend time with his daughter, Ariane, who lives with his ex-wife, Ottavia Busia, in New York. He also made frequent flights to Rome to spend time with his girlfriend, Italian actress, singer and director, Asia Argento.

“I’ll go back, see my daughter, unpack, repack, mimic a normal life, which is extraordinarily pleasurable to me,” he told People magazine. “I really love doing laundry. When I go home, putting my laundry in the machine and then hearing the dryer going around, that’s very comforting to me.”

During the 1990s New York experienced a rapid decline in crime.

Violent crimes dropped by 56% (double the national average of 28%).

Many attribute the massive drop to what has been coined the “Broken windows theory”.

The broken windows theory states that **crime is the inevitable result of chaos and disorder**.

If a window in a neighbourhood or city is left broken people will assume that no one is enforcing order.

With time another window in the building will break, then another and another.

Eventually, people will go for broke, break into the building and make themselves at home.

You might have seen a similar scenario happen to an abandoned car left on a roadside for too long.

Initially, no one touches the car, but with time, all of its components are stripped by vultures.

In 1994 New York, the police force under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration cracked down on petty crimes such as graffiti, fare-hopping, public urination, and theft.

They followed the broken windows philosophy.

They reasoned that if people could see order being enforced on small crimes, they wouldn’t have the confidence to pursue the bigger crimes.

If you were getting in trouble for not buying a $1.25 subway ticket, maybe robbing the 7/11 might not be such a good idea.

Some criminologists discredit the theory, but there is strong statistical data that shows its effectiveness.

# The Speech

In 2014, the decorated Admiral William H. McRaven gave a [commencement speech](https://app.getresponse.com/click.html?x=a62b&lc=B4CaUL&mc=I6&s=b3Djxc&u=zwlie&z=EQTCCW&) that went super viral on the internet.

The central message was the importance of making your bed every morning - a lesson deeply drilled into every Navy Seal.

The idea was through doing this simple act one can experience their first win of the day.

That win then gives them momentum to continue crushing the rest of their objectives.

It’s a feedback loop - success begets success.

From a brain chemistry prospective, achieving a small win triggers dopamine in the brain which motivates you to pursue the next task.

What Admiral McRaven was describing was the inverse broken windows effect.

Small positive tasks encourage other positive tasks.

Starting the day eating something healthy can motivate you to go the gym.

Three McDonalds Big Macs for breakfast can make you feel lethargic and create negative momentum.

*“I will just go tomorrow when I’m feeling better.”*

I’m sure you have rationalized this way before.

If you want to change your life, you need to start with the little things.

It’s these little things that compound over time to create extreme consequences.

Not having a budget leads a man to be broke at 70 with no retirement fund, savings or house. Instead, he is dependent on the government and relatives to take care of him.

It’s the cigarette at lunch that leads to not being able to play with your grandkids because you can’t even breathe properly. In the worst-case scenario it’s what leads to your lungs exploding inside your chest.

Not reading is what leads to you being left behind in the new economy where technology advances at a rate never seen before. Those who can’t evolve are left behind.

**Find your broken windows and start rebuilding your house.**

Cheers,

Isaac

3,"Procrastination is basically just fear, triggering the fight-or-flight response. Here are my 8 action steps to overcome this unconscious survival mechanism and reclaim control over your actions.","As a personal productivity specialist I have been pondering the subject of procrastination over and over again and today I decided to share with you what I consider to be the root cause or procrastination: the fight-or-flight response. 

In the second part you’ll find 8 action steps to overcome this unconscious survival mechanism and reclaim control over your actions. 

# Procrastination And The Fight-Or-Flight Response

  
**Procrastination limits your success in a variety of ways:**  
Bad grades, poor job performance, unhealthy diet choices, health issues, financial problems...

And if you don’t address this issue, this could have major consequences.   
Plus you’ll reduce the likelihood that you’ll achieve your major goals.  


**Of course you know you shouldn’t procrastinate on important things. But willpower doesn’t seem to be enough.** 

You procrastine even though you don’t want to, as if responding to an inner comand rather than choice. 

  
**So why do we compulsively avoid some of the most important things we could do with our time?**

When you read about the reasons people procrastinate, you often come across the same things: 

Perfectionism, being overwhelmed by a task, fear of failure, fear of the unknown etc.

And while these are true, they all stem from the same principle. 

Let me explain that. 

  
**Procrastination is basically just fear.**

Even though we live in the 21st century, our brain is still programmed to avoid potential danger and ensure survival. 

It still thinks we live in tribes, where being good enough to be part of the tribe was important for survival. 

What’s more, our brain doesn’t distinguish between real danger and unrealistic danger. 

So if we feel we are going to do a bad job at some complex task, this triggers the same kind of respons   
in our brain as if we were facing a sabertoothed tiger: fear.

And what’s the main function of fear? To keep us safe by triggering the fight-or-flight response. 

So if you are facing an activity you are dreading, for example a complex task,   
subconsciously you might fear the task is too difficult and that you might fail. 

This triggers the emotion of fear, which by law of survival must be avoided at all costs.

  
**Fight or flight.**

So when facing a task that makes us feel incompetent or out of our control, we have two options:

**1. Fight** **-** Gain knowledge about ourselves, and change our mindset and the situations we find ourselves in.  
**2. Flight** **-** Run away and seek shelter in distractions to hide from the feelings the situation gives us.

When you unconsciously pick option number 2, the result is procrastination.

  
**Procrastination is a mood-changer.**

As soon as we (unconsciously) experience these bad feelings, our brain desperately   
seeks a way out by doing something that makes us feel better short-term. 

For example, if you feel that some task is out of your control, you might distract yourself   
from that feeling by doing simple tasks (or Candy Crush!) that make you feel in control again.  

It‘s a way to avoid intolerable feelings.   


**We live in a quick-fix society.**

We are learning from both society and family models to turn to quick-fix short-term solutions. 

That’s why we often are unable to tolerate frustration and demand immediate gratification.   


**Even though procrastination gives you the short-term illusion of being better off, in reality you aren’t.**   
Playing Candy Crush instead of working on the things that matter most gives you a false sense   
of satisfaction, while in real life you are going backward. .

In choosing to procrastinate, you took what looked like the easier route and turned away from the   
one that forces you to deal with the feelings and problems you wanted to avoid. 

Procrastination produces pleasure, relief, and other payoffs in the short run but pain, anxiety,   
dissatisfaction, grief, guilt, stress, and a lot of practical problems in the long run.

Procrastinating problems keep piling up and soon there will be *real* reasons to be worried.  


# 8 Action Steps To Decondition Yourself From The Procratination Habit And Reclaim Control Over Your Actions

If you follow these action-steps, you will be able to decondition yourself and start   
replacing your old behavior by better ways to deal with challenging or intimidating activities.   


**Step 1. Become aware of the moments you want to procrastinate.**

When you do, stand up from your desk for a minute or 2 to break the cycle and consider the next steps.

  
**Step 2. Become aware of the feelings you have.**

Try to look at your feelings as if you were an outside observer. 

Observe the tendency to procrastinate from the perspective of “Isn’t that interesting“,   
rather than from “It’s going to get me“. 

Simply be okay with feeling whatever you feel. 

Telling yourself that it‘s okay to give in to any of those feelings, signals the brain that it’s ’safe’ out there.  

The fight-or-flight response will not be triggered (as much). 

  
**Step 3. Become aware of your inner dialogue.**

Listen to the little excuses and rationalizations that you tell yourself to start procrastinating.

  
**Step 4. Remember that you don’t have to act on it.**

Bad feelings and rationalizations don’t mean you have to give in to procrastination.

Confronting the feelings and excuses certain activities give you can seem scary. 

But if you look carefully, you can see how it is actually liberating to do so. 

You have been controlled by procrastination. 

Finally taking action on the right things is your way to freedom. 

  
**Step 5. Relax.**

Take a few deep breaths and relax your muscles, stimulating the brain to feel okay with the current situation. 

  
**Step 6. Make the activity at hand less intimidating.**

Break up the task or activity at hand into smaller steps to make it less overwhelming.

  
**Step 7. Set intentions.**

Now set intentions for what you’re about to do. 

Maybe this means just working for 5 minutes on the easiest task on your list from step 6. 

Your main goal should be to make it as easy as possible to get started. 

And once you have some momentum, it’s much easier to get going.

  
**Step 8. Get started and keep going**

Just get started on some easy aspect of the big task. 

Use a timer or app blocker like Forest to disable possible distractions. 

Finish what you intended to do. 

&#x200B;

**In reality, none of us is either totally perfect or totally worthless...**

If we allow this wisdom in our consciousness,   
we gain freedom because we no longer have to maintain the illusion of perfection.   
To admit that we aren’t fully in control and that we aren’t complete failures, we gain freedom. 

We become free to *risk* facing and coping with the real world,   
because making mistakes no longer makes us feel like failures. 

We can learn to accept ourselves and others as we are and stop trying to control everything. 

We can stop blaming everyone else for what’s wrong in our lives, and start changing what we can.

I have about 1,000 screenshots of motivational stuff, about 500 or more I don’t even know the number of saved posts and about 1,000+ comments saved on reddit.

You see all these comments and posts is all supposed to encourage me and take action right? It’s done the opposite for me. It’s like I get a short bit of dopamine then I go back to doing what I’m doing on autopilot. It’s as if I’m identifying myself with my phone.

As I’m deleting each post and removing all the posts I saved it , physically hurts? Maybe because I identified myself with it. Imagine if I lost my phone or threw it out the window. I would be lost. I probably couldn’t even operate. It would force me to go within but all the shit I saved is gone which means now I’m going to have to TRUST myself. And that’s all I realized just now.

6,The Only Productivity Hack That Really Matters - Sleep Optimization,"I get it, the productivity space is all about using tools and shortcuts to get as much sh\*t done as quickly and effectively as possible. 

However, let me tell you that **Sleep is the key to unlock effective and sustainable productivity**.   
There’s an abundance of information across scientific literature that highlights sleep as the biggest catalyst in performance - both physical and cognitive. 

Now that we cleared that, let’s get down to the brass tacks.   
**Two critical productivity concepts to grasp:**

**Circadian Rhythm**

* Think of the Circadian Rhythm as your biological daily energy schedule shaped as a rolling wave that peaks and dips across the day. 
* During your Circadian Peaks, which, for many, fall in the late morning and late afternoon, every cell in your body is programmed to be alert and ready to perform. 
* Conversely, during your Circadian Dip, which generally occurs in the early afternoon, your body is naturally programmed to be relaxed and in recovery. 

**Sleep Debt**

* Sleep debt refers to the cumulative hours of sleep lost over a period of approximately two weeks, relative to your own sleep needs. The more sleep debt you carry the more likely you are to see a dip in your daily productivity (common sense).

**How to Leverage Your Circadian Rhythm for Peak Productivity:**

* **Morning ramp-up:** Wake up and get your lymphatic system moving and your mindset in check. As your energy rises, plan the day ahead.
* **Morning peak:** Reserve this time for complex work that demands your highest level of focus, such as important activities that require high emotional fortitude and brain cycle allocation.
* **Afternoon dip:** This is a good time to tackle passive administrative tasks like emails or CRM updates. Depending on your schedule, you could try to squeeze in a workout or take a little siesta.
* **Evening peak**: Last peak of the day, so make it count. Knock out a couple more deliverables and tasks that require a high level of focus or collaborative effort. 
* **Evening wind-down:** Time to ramp down, unplug, and relax. Do not ignore your wind-down window as it is the precursor for a good night sleep. You should take steps to ensure you have a consistent easing-off-into-bed ritual. Remember, recovery is crucial for productivity.

**Sleep Optimization Tips To Reduce Sleep Debt:**

* Start using blue light protection glasses if you spend too much time staring at screens. A cheap pair from [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) will get the job done.
* Integrate gamification in your stack. On this, there are many apps to choose from. I like [Risescience.com](https://Risescience.com).
* Cold is your friend. Keep your bedroom on the colder side. It will enhance your sleep.

  
**Jumping Over Hundred Dollar Bills To Pick Up Nickels**

Very often, I see people (fellow entrepreneurs mostly), stacking up on the latest productivity tools and supplements in an attempt to gain that extra edge.

Unfortunately what most of these good folks need is a good sleep hygiene habit. **Don’t fall victim to the hype**. Get your sleep in order first.

&#x200B;

**PS**. How have you guys seen sleep impact your daily productivity? Do you implement specific sleep hygiene best practices?  
**PPS**. Long time lurker, first time poster... so go easy on me haha.

⋆Proceeds to dick around on Reddit instead of work⋆

*…*

Sound familiar?

This, amigo, is called Resistance. That overwhelming-repulsion-to-work-that-makes-it-seem-like-the-task-at-hand-is-a-worse-idea-than-licking-the-damp-inside-corner-of-a-bus-shelter-while-setting-it-aside-to-browse-through-r /memes-the-absolute-best-idea-ever?…-*Re-effing-sistance.*

Resistance is a thing; and it will come to punch you in the mouth and sabotage you and your precious plans, promises and resolutions—just like it did last week.

*(At this point, I need to give credit to Steven Pressfield and his epic book The War of Art, in which he coined the term Resistance and managed to describe this feeling and it's effects so perfectly)*

So ok, what to do about?

Well, the way I see it, you have 3 options :

**Option 1**: Willpower through it with gritted teeth. *Motivation is overrated*: just will your hands to move and type, letter by letter, like you’re operating a finicky crane machine in an old arcade.

This is possible, but, like wading upstream of a swift current, my-oh-my is this exhausting. Productivity prodigies like, I don’t know…*David Goggins?…* they can enter the ring with the beast and box through all 12 rounds, but mortals like me and you just won’t have the stamina. No bueno.

**Option 2**: Do the opposite: indulge the craving for the vice in the hopes that the Resistance will pass and you’ll be able to return to your work session which a clear brain and a little more focus and motivation.

Lol at this method. It of course never pans out the way you hope, instead snowballing out to all-out binge. Anyway, again, obviously, no bueno.

**Option 3**: You can *Super Mario the sh\*t out of it*.

This is what I do and it works. Allow me to explain.

So you’re 8 again and you’re playing Super Mario World in the basement. You enter a haunted house level (go ahead and play that eerie door hinge sound effect in your head). You advance a bit, when, out from behind you an angry ghost lurches forward. This makes you panic, but you mange to turn Mario around in time. *Phew.*

Here’s the thing. Looking at the ghost doesn't make it die or go away. There's nothing you can do to make Mario eliminate it. The only thing Mario can do is *manage* the ghosts.

With the ghost immobilized, you can take a breath and plan out your next moves. *Ok, I’ll jump on that platform; hit that question mark block; run and duck under that flame, then turn around again and recoup. Ready?... ⋆exhale⋆… ok go...*

In the same way, you can only *manage* Resistance. And this can only be done by facing it—by bringing it into your awareness, like it’s an outside *thing* happening that you can look at and observe.

*Hmm… there he is again… ah yessss… Resistance…what a jerk.*

Now, just like with Mario and the ghost, mindfully ‘facing’ the Resistance doesn’t make it go away unfortunetely.

With the Resistance immobilized, you can however plan out your next moves, just as you would with Mario. *Ok… I feel the resistance. I feel the overwhelm at how much work is involved with this project. It’s not pleasant, but it is what it is. Ok fine… now, first move: go through my notes and extract the first argument. Then, convert it into a paragraph, then, ok, I’ll pause and recoup. Ready?... ⋆exhale⋆… ok go...*

Then, just as you would playing Mario, with a super focused mental space (i.e. mindful and present to the moment), diligently, carefully, slowly perform the first tiny task. Then move on to the next, again, carefully.

If/when you feel the ghost of Resistance creep back towards; again, stop. Turn around. Look at it. Observe it. Feel it. Take a few breathes, then plan your next moves.

Then go forward some more.

String together enough of these ‘stop, observe, plan, go’ sequences and you’ll get through your work session unscathed. It might not be the quickest possible way to get things done—*the quickest way to beat the haunted house level is to ignore the ghosts and sprint through non-stop*—but it’s the surest way. For me, it’s been the only sustainable way to ramp up and maintain a solid and consistent work session habit.

So that’s it. Best of luck to you in your noble quest for higher productivity. And don’t forget: if you slip a bit and get nicked by the dang ghost again… don’t chuck the controller at your little brother as you did when you were 8… be kind to yourself and just use an extra life to start again… You got this!

\- Simon ㋛

EDIT: I had a few comments and PMs asking how this can be done—as in a step-by-step procedure. Admittedly me telling you to ""look at the resistance and observe"" is still quite vague and intangible in terms of practical application. This is my way of packaging and introducing the SUPER useful and game-changing practice of mindfulness (it's at the core of CBT), but it can be tricky to get started. So you're not alone if you find that it sounds promising, but you don't know if/how you can turn the practice into a valuable habit.

If that's you, considering joining the free webinar I'm putting together this Saturday. There's more info in a comment below, but it's geared towards helping you stay focused and motivated when you sit down for you work sessions. It uses a step-by-step process and tools like mindfulness.  Check it out at [simond.me/sws](https://www.simond.me/sws)

14,"If I had only 1 piece of productivity advice to give, it's this.","I love the concept of productivity. Really, I have jumped into a deep rabbit hole of learning about apps and tips and tricks. 

It's seriously awesome how many people have these hidden gems to share that have real-world implications. 

I think that's what makes productivity advice so cool is that it's very actionable, unlike other topics.

You tell me about this app and how to use it, I follow your advice, and boom...real-world implication.

That being said, we can get so tangled in all the mental models and apps and concepts that we forget one thing: Just getting started.

# If I had only 1 piece of productivity advice to give, it's this (and it isn't even mine): 

**Newton's first law** states that an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion at the same velocity unless acted on by an unbalanced force. 

Using this law in productivity, if you stay in sloth mode, you'll remain in sloth mode.

If you decide to jumpstart yourself and get started on something, you'll get the ball rolling.

The key to being more productive is to ***just get started***. 

Keyword: **started**

Don't think about anything else but just **starting** the task.

* No perfectionism
* No analysis paralysis
* No procrastination 
* No overthinking
* No weird inner dialogue

Whatever it is you want to do, just **start** it even if it's for 2 minutes.

It's why when you **start** cleaning, you find it easier to keep cleaning.

When you **start** walking, you find it easier to keep walking.

The beginning is difficult, but the momentum makes it easier.

# Actionable advice

Grab a timer, set it for 2 minutes, and **start** the thing you're avoiding.

Why 2 minutes?

60 seconds to be grumpily doing the task: ""Why am I doing this, I really don't wanna do this, Ugh I don't feel like doing this.""

Another 60 seconds for ""Alright I'm doing this, This isn't that bad, Okay let's do this.""

I guarantee giving yourself 120 seconds to **start** things will make you more productive.",m1eoye,1114,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/m1eoye/if_i_had_only_1_piece_of_productivity_advice_to/
15,PSA : You don't need to wake up early to be successful,"My first time posting here, long time lurker.

I have seen a lot of posts in this sub, plus YouTube about how you should get up early to be successful in life, and if you don't do it, you won't be successful. **IT IS NOT TRUE**

People who wake up at around 4:00 - 5:00 a.m. are people who are **MORNING PEOPLE**.  One study found that **night owls** make up around 20 **percent** of the population. So there is a good chance that you are a night owl, and not a morning person. So not only are you waking up early, by ruining your sleep; You are also lowering the efficiency of the amount of time you spent studying. 

So here is my thoughts. There is 24 hours in a day. So if someone wakes up at around let's say 4:00 am, they usually go to sleep around 9:00pm, equating to 7 hours of sleep. If you go to bed at 1:00 am and wake up at 8:00am, it is ALSO 7 hours of sleep. Basically, you don't need to wake up early to be successful, you just need to figure out what time works for you. You might be a parent and need an hour or two to study/work/productive in the morning before the kids wake up. Or you might live with your family and want the peace and quite time at night to focus. What I am basically saying is do what works best for you, don't force something that just because you saw a post or a popular youtuber.

That's all, thank you for reading. Have a great day.

19,5 simple steps to wake up early and energized without fail,"I wished for many years to wake up early and be a morning ninja, but every time I tried, I just felt like a zombie. In this post I’d like to share the 5 steps that actually solved the problem for me.

The key takeaway is that waking up early is all about properly and efficiently energizing yourself, not about sleep deprivation. Research shows that sleep is for high performers, enabling the highest levels of mental, emotional, and physical contribution. So simply giving yourself less sleep is actually a self-defeating strategy.

The key question here that needs to be answered is: How you can energize yourself more efficiently, so you can both save time, as well as boost your energy level and gain momentum for the whole day?

Here are my 5 very simple steps to answer the question and solve the problem:

# Step 1. Define your bedtime.

o What time do you have to get up in the morning, looking at the things you want to and have to do?o How many hours of sleep do you need to feel optimally rested (anywhere between 7-9)?

Bedtime formula = Ideal wakeup time MINUS hours of sleep needed.

# Step 2. Unstimulate the brain before bed (nighttime routine).

Create a wind-down nighttime routine. This will make it easier to fall asleep and it will improve the quality and efficiency of your sleep as well.

**AVOID whatever is ACTIVATING your body, mind, and soul:**

o Don’t have coffee afer 2pm

o Don’t eat or drink alcohol within 2 hours of your bedtime

o Don’t do highly energizing exercises or activites

o Don’t watch screens one hour before bed

o Don’t think or read about complex things before bed

**DO whatever is RELAXING your body, mind, and soul:**

o Take a hot shower/bath

o Go for a relaxing walk

o Stretch, mild exercise, yoga

o (Guided) meditationo Writing, drawing or any relaxing hobby

o Drink something warmo Massage

o Relaxation techniques, breathing exercises

o Reading (printed) something relaxing or silly

o Etc.

# Step 3. Improve the quality of your sleep.

Before trying to wake up earlier, you’ll have to improve the quality of your sleep first.The goal of waking up ealier is to feel more energized, to get more done, and to save time, not to become a member of the Living-Dead Club.

Use this checklist to see if there’s anything you can do to improve the quality of your sleep. Aim for at least 8/10 for each statement.

o I have the same bedtime and wake up time every day

o I practice some relaxing bedtime ritual

o I exercise daily (some form or other)

o I see plenty of daylight every day

o There’s no screen time, food or coffee/alcohol/cigarettes before bed

o I use my evenings to relax and wind down

o I have a comfortable mattress and pillow

o My room is completely silent when I sleep

o My room is completely dark when I sleep

o If needed, I sleep with ear plugs and an eye mask

o I don’t take (substantial) naps during the day

o I never use the snooze button in the morning, but get up immediately

o If I can’t sleep, I do something relaxing until I feel tired

# Step 4. Shift your wake up time by incremental change

After you’ve put step 1-3 into practice, you should wait until your new bedtime has become a habit and you feel that the quality of your sleep is decent. Up until then, you shouldn’t continue with step 4 and try to wake up earlier.

But once you feel that you can fall asleep relaxed and have a good night’s rest, it’s time to shift your wake up time gradually.

The goal here is to substitute sleeping more for energizing and activating activities in the morning. Remember, waking up early is all about properly and efficiently energizing yourself, not about sleep deprivation.

The system for this step works like this:

**1. Start shifting your wake up time by 5 minutes.**

Instead of those 5 minutes of sleep, you will perform energizing activities.

(How to energize yourself is described in step 5.)

**2. Once you feel okay with those 5 minutes, shift another 5 minutes, simultaneously expanding your energization routine.**

You will hardly notice that you’ve cut back 5 minutes on your sleep. Yet things can add up quickly, and perhaps in one month time, you will be getting up one hour ealier already.

**3. Continue shifting by 5 minutes until you’ve reached your desired wake up time.**

At some point you won’t need to substitute every minute by energization activities. Of course you’re free to do so, but after 30 minutes of energization you will probably already be highly energized.

# Step 5. Energize yourself in the morning

The key question here is:

**What do you need to do to gain momentum and start the day feeling energized?**

**When designing your morning routine, make sure to include:**

o Expose yourself to bright light (natural or use a full spectrum light).

o Hydrate: your body needs water within 30 minutes after getting up.

o Feed your body: fruit, grains, smoothie etc. Not too much, not too little.

o Have some oxygen: do an activating breathing exercise like the Bellow’s Breath (which is a personal favourite of Tony Robbins).

o Get your heart pumping: walk, jog, exercise, activating yoga, jumping jacks etc.

o Awaken your mind: meditate, affirm your daily purpose, visualize etc.

It’s less important what you do exactly. More important is that you find something that makes YOU feel fully awake, and that you do it every day. Once you get up earlier and earlier, you can keep expanding your energization routine until you feel fully energized.

Additionally it is important to practice some energy management throughout the day. Make sure to have regular breaks and meals during the day and plan for enough downtime after your duties. And once you combine energy management during the day with a powerful morning routine, you'll probably never want to go back.

# Make the most of your life!

Starting your day early and energized has too many benefits to count, but at the core of it always is living life to your full potential.

Once you’ve given yourself a kickstart for the day, make sure to make the most of it.

Become the best version of yourself. Live life on your terms. Crush your personal or business goals. Get in the best physical shape of your life. Create priceless memories with friends and family. And live your life to the fullest.

20,"Don't go on autopilot. After every activity think, see your watch, and Ponder for a while","Doesnt matter if it's a Tv show, a game, a phone call, or scrolling insta.

It's inevitable that you go into an autopilot (apps today lure you in) but when you get your attention just for a brief time period - like an end of an episode, a boss fight

1. Stop that activity and see the time
2. Ask yourself whether it's okay to watch another episode or scroll for another hour
3. If the answer is Yes, carry on. No worries.
4. If the answer is No, you know what to do.

The key here is NOT about fearing the time you've spent or the time that's left.

JUST BEING AWARE OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

Autopilot is majorly the cause for procrastination, binge watching, mindless scrolling.

Pro Tip : I switch off the Tv And write on a paper of the things I feel like doing today. And if I still want to continue watching an episode, I do.
That gets me out of the autopilot zone and lets me think with clear mind.",njbqxi,1052,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/njbqxi/dont_go_on_autopilot_after_every_activity_think/

------



* **""I literally can't even tell what I'm feeling righ now""**: Like the right-below-mentioned mindmap app, but this time on a scrap paper. Instead of actively trying to make a structured map or to figure out ""what to do next"", I just write absolute nonsense onto a shitty scrap of paper I know I'll throw out. I'll write things like ""I feel hungry."" and then realize I'm actually hungry and that's why I can't think for shit. Or ""Debra still needs to email me her reply"" and just voicing that helps give that cycling thought an outlet, so I can move on and focus on something else. I like keeping a big scrappy ""school-workbook"" to a college I never went to, as I can write/doodle in it without worrying about making something nice-looking. It's the unfiltered braindump recepticle. 

^TL;DR: ^Braindumping.

* **""My Brain is Full of Bees"":**  I use ""MiMind"" Mindmapping to help me braindump a bajillion buzzing thoughts onto a single 'board'. MiMind specifically allows me to make unstructured mindmaps, so I don't have to come up with a 'master' node to link everything to. I can just make a random floating bubble anywhere on the board, and THEN eventually link it to something when I realize ""Oh X task is related to Y over here, actually"" or ""I want to do XYZ, but ABC is preventing me from doing that so looks like I have to do ABC first."" This helps alleviate the feeling of chaotic-stress or ""too much going on"".


^TL;DR: ^Mindmapping.

* **""What the fuck am I doing next again?""**: Workflowy is a free *minimalist* list-tree app that I use as both a Masterlist for references I need (A list of addresses, links, projects, goals, emails, task-trees, etc) and as a way to turn a series of tasks into a linear step-by-step. They recently implimented a function that allows you to make ""boards"" you can drag and drop lists into. I've been using a three-section board of *""Do Soon""*, *""Do Eventually""*, and *""Would be Neat""* to help me separate tasks. Do-soon is stuff I'm either doing TODAY or this-week, or ought to do next. ""Do Eventually"" is for things that either aren't time sensitive, or I can't pursue yet because something else has to be done first. ""Would be Neat"" is for everything else -- like things that would be nice to have but aren't immediately pressing nor life-changingly important. If you had to pick only one tool, I vouch Workflowy, as it's also *free* and you can use it across both PC and phones. It's minimalist built is also incredibly ADHD friendly, and fast enough to launch that I don't get distracted before I get to insert something.

^TL;DR: ^Section ^tasks ^as ^""Do ^Soon, ^Do ^Eventually, ^Would ^be ^neat"".

* **""I keep losing track of all this important shit"":** Learning Gsheets and how to make aesthetically legible charts is not just a work-transferrable skill, but absolutely fucking crucial to craft your own ADHD-Reference ""Masterbook of Important Shit"". I've created myself a single massive document with different tabs for different topics, like my own personal financial-tracking, my long-term project aspirations, a reference list of all the Zoom links I need  to have on-hand (and to who/what they're tied to). You can make a bajillion different tabs all in the same file, color-code them, and adjust them to your hyper-specific needs. You won't make your first sheet into a work of art -- you're going to make a lot of shitty ones first. But over time you'll learn what worked, what doesn't work, and what needs you actually have. The Gsheet community is very helpful too, and learning how to create a sublime reference sheet for yourself will free up a lot of our valuable-and-lacking mental RAM-space. I *know* I'm not going to remember what email I received the Zoom Meeting link in -- but I also *know* which tab I need to open in order to find it. Having ADHD means we have to *constantly* externalize what we ""know"" into ""I know where to find it.""

^TL;DR: ^Externalize ^your ^knowledge/information-needs ^onto ^one ^Gsheet ^with ^sectioned ^tabs.

* **""Why can't I fucking get started on this"":** TimeTimer is a free app that compensates a crucial ADHD problem: our inability to have a sense of time. We have ""Now"" or ""Not Now"" as our sense of timing, and ""Forever"" or ""Nothing"" as our sense of how long something will take. TimeTimer externalizes our sense of time into a *visual shrinking pie-chart* that cures the procrastination-anxiety that manifests when we feel that something will take forever to do. Dishes that feel endless suddenly feel easy to do when you have a visual timer indicating ""15 minutes"" that's shrinking down. Being able to visually see time disappearing, really helps to motivate yourself to pursue a task and to make said task appear a lot less all-consuming. We freeze when we can't see the end to a task/project, a visual timer gives us freedom and clarity of mind when we're like this. Numbers counting down is still too 'abstract' for a lot of us, but seeing something shrink down over time gives a much more concrete sense of time.

^TL;DR: ^Visual ^Timers ^((shrinking pie-charts, hourglasses) ^) ^removes ^time-anxiety.

* **""I keep fucking wandering off mid-task"":** Junebugging is a concept where you ""assign"" yourself an anchor point. Say you want to clean the dishes but keep wandering off; you make the kitchen sink your ""Anchor point."" You get started on the dishes, but something distracts you (like taking out the trash) so you wander off to remove the trash. Eventually you'll remember ""oh yeah I'm Junebugging"" and you return to the sink. Your work-process is going to look Chaotic as Fuck from the outside, but you'll *eventually* finish the dishes, AND have accomplished a bunch of random tasks surrounding that physical space (trash, cleaning the oven, changing out the dishtowels, changing lightbulbs, sweeping). Having ADHD involves accepting that you'll have SOME 'wandering off', but we can guide our hurricane-of-chaotic-attention to specific areas/topics versus punishing ourselves for being unable to focus on One Thing. The next-level refinement of Junebugging is taking a day to deliberately list yourself a bunch of 'cluster tasks' you can do together and default to when junebugging. You can also apply this to digital programs/folders/emails, though I recommend an external post-it note reminder of what you're presently junebugging, for lack of physical anchor.

^TL;DR: ^Junebugging.

* **""I fucking hate alarms but I need alarms"":** I only recently found this but I like it immensely; TimeTune allows you to create *clusters* of alarms you can turn on/off. I have alarm/audio-notifications set to go off 5 minutes before specific meetings, specific time-sensitive work-events, to remind me to *prepare* for work, and even to go off when work itself starts *and* ends. Timetune allows you to turn off entire routines of alarms (so if you have a day off you don't have to remove 10 alarms at once and remember to add 10 alarms the next day), and it allows you to choose much less obstructive sound-cues if you just need a quick audible beep versus a much more unpleasant and invasive wakeup-alarm. While getting visual notifications (at first) seems like an obvious ADHD solution, we risk getting ""Notification Overload"" where we just start dismissing notifications without even reading or noticing them. Timetune gives you the breathing-room of just a quick reminder-beep or chime without demanding your full attention and disrupting you from your workflow. 

^TL;DR: ^use ^cluster ^alarms/notification ^apps ^that ^are ^pleasant ^to ^use.

* **""What am I even doing with my life"":** Physical agenda books. *""I get started on them but I never use them after""* -- Then you don't have the agenda book that fits your needs. There's planners out there that split up days into hourly sections, and include monthly journal-like check-ins where you can look back and assess what worked, what didn't work, and if you're pursuing things that are aligning to your own personal goals/desires along with reminders to appreciate the people around you. I vouch for PassionPlanner, personally, but I've also moved on to finding other Agenda planners that you can order online, that allow you to choose the layout of your pages. (I wanted a minimalist planner that gives me space for notes but also has days sectioned by half-hours, for example). In addition, *find the pens that you want to use.* It has to feel good for us to use it. I also enjoy the excuse of slapping in stickers on everything, but that's just me. You have to turn your planner into something you have fun using, and *want to use.* Some people prefer undated planners, because we might 'skip' a few months and then feel bad about 'wasting' these months, but with an undated planner, you can just resume on your last page and write in the next few dates. The useage of stickers motivates me to actively add in distant/future meetings & events, and gives me an excuse to open the book frequently enough to track my life.

^TL;DR: ^Find ^the ^planner ^that ^works ^for ^YOU ^specifically.

* **""Seriously, I'm just repeating in cycles"":** Less a ""thing"" and more a philosophy; we are often trapped by our past habits and past lifestyles, traumas, habit patterns, etc. ""What we spend mental energy on is what we become"" in a *very* simplified version of a bigger idea, but; what's the solution to that? *Pull from the future.* Think about who you want to become, where you want to be. Think about the possible paths you would need to take to get there. Would it take therapy? Community support? Getting fit? Switching careers? The danger of introspection is we can get caught-up in how we *were* that we forget to look to who we could *become.* It gets a lot easier to pursue new habits, new efforts, when we can actually identify if we're on ""the right track"" or not.

^TL;DR: ^Read/Listen-to-Audiobook ^""Unfuck ^Yourself""/ ^Be ^inspired ^by ^your ^future ^ideal ^self.

* **""My Name's Jared & I can't Read"":** Trust me; subscribing to a cheap audiobook platform is lifechanging. I'm speaking as someone who *also* has a hearing disability; the benefit of an audiobook platform is that you can repeat the same book multiple times over, with no effort. You can use audiobooks as background noise to 'pad' unpleasant tasks like chores, dishes, and feed yourself media while doing something unpleasant or time-consuming. Plus, instead of impulse-purchasing fifty self-help books with only one or two you might skim through, having a portable book platform (like Scribd) lets you test-run as many self-help/productivity books as you want, without feeling like you 'have' to use this specific book if you don't vibe with it. You get to speed-run your own research on finding the solutions to your specific problem. Or use books as people-noises to go to sleep to. Learn by atmospheric osmosis.

^TL;DR: ^Abuse ^audiobook ^platforms ^like ^you're ^robbing ^a ^library.

* I no longer feel like a day is wasted, improving my self esteem (I used to berate myself if I didn't accomplish enough)
* Since my to do list can only have 3 things on it, I end up doing 'smaller' things that take less than 10 minutes with no hesitation, further increasing my productivity
* I don't write down things like exercise or meditation and created a routine where these things are fun so I don't feel like they're a task

* I got into grad school and I'm at the top of my class & got a research grant (because I'm not as burned out as my peers, I'm not very smart and nearly failed out of high school)

I owe all these positive changes to this method, and meditation.

I drastically changed my life and it took little energy, as I was depressed and didn't have much to spare. I'm so happy this worked out and If you were like I was (stressed, constantly trying to change, no energy to do so) this may work for you, or maybe an element of this will.

I hope you enjoy this update!

**EDIT: Thank you for the award!**

**EDIT:**

Here are some clarifications to the common questions:

The most important aspects of this method are:

1. Not to waste your 3 to-do list slots on small/trivial things. This forces you to batch things together into something like: Do morning routine or get all homework done, instead of wasting your slots on: brush teeth, get dressed, wash hair for example.
2. By only allowing yourself 3 things you don't get burned out making a massive to do list
3. If you can't prioritize 3 tasks a day, in my case it meant I needed this method more than ever.
4. Its DIFFICULT at first because you think you need to do more. But you'll notice, over time, that you do small things anyway and don't need to write them down (like vacuuming for example) Its an easy method to learn but that doesn't mean its easy to do.

EDIT: I would also like to add that because of this method I don't take days off, because I don't need to. So imagine getting 2 extra days to get 3 important things done!",m8ne82,986,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/m8ne82/one_year_after_doing_only_3_tasks_a_day_heres_an/
28,Done is better than perfect.,"The phrase “done is better than perfect,” has started to change my productivity journey in amazing ways. Focusing on just completing something, and maybe doing so in a way that’s a bit unordinary, is a more productive mindset than focusing on perfection. Drop preconceived notions of how and when things should be done and do what works for you. Small scale example would be making my bed in the morning: because I didn’t feel like taking everything off the bed, going through all the “correct steps”, etc., I wouldn’t do it. Now I sit in my bed, organize my pillows and fix the blanket up just a bit. It’s not perfect looking,  but for the past few weeks my bed has been made in the morning. This can be easily applied to any work/studying you may be procrastinating as well. If you’ve been pushing off an essay, just get anything and everything you know on the paper, it doesn’t have to be perfect or organized or even make sense, everybody starts somewhere. Done is better than perfect.",q2o1ud,971,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/q2o1ud/done_is_better_than_perfect/
29,"If you really want to be productive TODAY, you need to put your phone down right now and stop trying to find the “perfect” motivation.","If you want to read forward go ahead to the “Start Right Now”, but I also want to share the potentially life changing tip I’ve discovered:

When you wake up - Do. Not. Unlock. Your. Phone. Unlocking your phone just opens the gates of “let me just check this one thing” and you never end up just checking one thing.  If I even want to put on (instrumental) music, I will use Siri so I don’t have to unlock my phone.

The only thing I may unlock my phone for is a productivity and focus meditation, but in my experience I’ve actually been more productive when I skip it to avoid my phone entirely.

If you start in the morning reading “one quick thing” it already shortens your attention span for the day.



For the “Start Right Now” advice:

The past several days I’ve been looking online for motivation and skills to be more productive. I barely get anything done because I keep waiting for the “perfect” motivation or advice that will get me started.

It will never come if you haven’t started the task. It’s overwhelming to start, but just think of one small task to begin with.  And don’t let that first task be writing a list of steps on how to get it done...

You can do that after you’ve completed one step of the actual task at hand.  Don’t put any pressure on starting the task perfectly or “in order.” Just get your brain familiar with working on the project.

I’ve read “start right now” posts, and they get me motivated, but I’ll continue browsing for more motivation to help me start right now.  Never works.

It’s so hard to put your phone down when you think maybe you just haven’t gotten to the advice that “works.” Continuing browsing will never work.

**If you really want to be productive today, don’t even comment on this post and lock your phone. Let this be the last thing you read.**

Edit: One last thing to add - prop up your phone at your workspace and use the Time-Lapse feature on your phone camera.  The goal is to see how long you can leave your phone on Time-Lapse and you get to watch back all the work you got done.

- This may not be for everyone, but I also made a TikTok account solely for posting videos of my Time-Lapses as a second way to hold myself accountable.  It’s fun adding music behind the work and having a “final product” of all the work you’ve completed.",n9x1r4,970,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/n9x1r4/if_you_really_want_to_be_productive_today_you/

31,What I learned from reading the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,"Hi there,

I recently read 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. This book is incredibly popular, but I’ve looked down on it for a long time because of the name.  Now I have finally read it, I’m struck simultaneously by both how true the insights are, and how few of the habits I actually stick to, despite thinking of them as common sense. I have found it useful because of the way that it synthesises specific pieces of insight to short mantras such as “be proactive” and gives you specific things to do in order to adopt each habit.

In the introduction, Covey recommends that you read the book with a view on how to teach it to others, rather than as something you are learning, so this summary is me attempting to share the knowledge I’ve acquired. I also recommend, in order to remember it, you **use a spaced repetition tool like** [**Save All**](https://saveall.ai/landing/reddit_posts). I’ve created a deck [here](https://saveall.ai/shared/deck/5973&8&oorMnDMjqks&reddit_posts) that summarises the important points from this book. I’m trying to use this deck to remember the habits, so I can actually put them into practise.

**What is effectiveness?**

Covey defines effectiveness as the P/PC balance. P stands for production output. And PC stands for production capability. In order to be effective, you need to manage these two, and spend time producing as well as ensuring your means to be producing are looked after and in good shape.

**Habit 1: Be proactive**

Being proactive in this context means taking responsibility for your own responses to things. Proactivity means you recognise the difference between things you can influence and things you are concerned about. Being proactive means you accept responsibility for the things you have control over, that you accept responsibility to work on your method of influence on things you only have indirect control over, and that you do not focus on things you have no control over.

**Ways to be proactive:**

1. Consider the language you use when you are thinking about why something happened. Do not say, “I am just like that”, say “I choose not to be like that”
2. Write down 5 things that are worrying you right now. Label them as “circle of influence” if you can do something about them, or “circle of concern” if you can not. Where do you spend most of your time?
3. Make some very small commitments to yourself and keep them. Then start to make them bigger over time

**Habit 2: Start with the end in mind**

Starting with the end in mind is a principle that applies to your entire life, and to any individual action. When you do anything, you create it in your mind first, then you make it in the world. If you do not consider where and why you are going first, then your method of creation will be governed by your pre-existing habits. Applying this to your life, you should consider which values you hold in your center. If you are centered around something external like friendship or romance, your values are unstable and liable to cause pain if circumstances change. If you center your life around principles like trust or honesty, your commitment to the plan can be maintained in the face of adversity.

**Ways to start with the end in mind:**

1. As Covey recommends, create a personal mission statement. Try writing down the character you want to be, the contribution you want to make, and the values or principles upon which these are based.
2. Try, before you start something, visualising what the world will be like once you have finished it. For example, how happy everyone will be that you cooked the meal. Then make it more ambitious!

**Habit 3: First things first**

Organise and execute around priorities. This habit is making sure you work on the important things, not just the urgent things. Covey recommends you look at all the tasks in your life, and put them in quadrants, where you compare their importance and their urgency. You must always do the important/urgent things first. Then, you strive to maximise the important/non-urgent while minimising your time spent on the unimportant and urgent.

**Ways to do first things first**

1. Try actually putting everything on a quadrant and see what happens. Are you spending too much time working on urgent and unimportant things?
2. Allocate time in your schedule to work on the important but not urgent things.
3. Practise saying no
4. Plan the week ahead

**Habit 4: Think win/win**

This habit involves viewing situations through the paradigm of win/win. Remember that in most situations, there is a way where everyone gets what they want.

**Ways to think win/win**

1. Consider an upcoming situation and think about how you can think win/win
2. Think about people you know. Who has a win/win approach, and who has a win/lose approach?

**Habit 5: First seek to understand, then to be understood**

This habit means that you should diagnose before you prescribe. First, seek to fully understand. There are three elements that are necessary for deep understanding: personal credibility, emotional resonance, and reason. This applies both ways.

**Ways to seek first to understand**

1. When listening to what people say, think about who they are and why they think what they do. Try asking them about how they came by their opinions.
2. If someone disagrees with you, try explaining their argument back to them in a way that they agree represents their argument fairly.

**Habit 6: Synergize**

This habit means you should look to see ways of communicating and interacting where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. You can do this by valuing diversity of opinion - valuing the differences as Covey refers to it.

**Ways to synergize:**

1. Seek out someone from a different discipline to you and ask them about a decision you have to make.
2. Think about meetings that are usually clashes, and figure out how to leverage synergy. For example, perhaps you can ask an engineer

**Habit 7: Sharpen the saw**

Sharpening the saw means spending time regularly to ensure you are improving yourself, rather than simply producing.

**Ways to sharpen the saw:**

1. Get into a regular exercise regimen, no matter now small
2. Take the time to adopt the 7 habits as part of your life

**Overall:**

If you want to live an effective life, with a strong P/PC balance, you need to be proactive about your own responses to things, keep your commitments, and focus on your circle of influence. You need to visualise the end result, before you begin. In particular, you want to think which values you want your life to represent, and try to live by them. You should consider things in terms of urgency and importance, do the important and urgent things first, then focus as much as possible on the non-urgent and important. You should try and seek solutions to situations where both parties come off better. You should diagnose before you prescribe. Value differences in opinion, and try to look for ways to work with people who think differently. Lastly, make sure you spend the time you need to keep yourself in good shape to maintain all the 7 habits.

Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.""

33,"Plan your week, not your whole life. Get unstuck, stay productive.","I have been struggling with using my time most effectively and efficiently so that my productivity is high and simultaneously I don’t feel burn out. I tried a lot of different methods, but nothing worked perfectly for me. Then, I accidentally discovered this method while I was scheduling my goals.

My goal was to increase my productivity without sacrificing the quality of my work and life! I wanted to peacefully work on tasks at hand without worrying about millions of other things. At the end of the day, I wanted to feel satisfied and fulfilled. You know, I am a creative and highly energetic person. I get thousands of ideas and want to learn millions of things. So no matter how hard I work, no matter how intelligently I develop something, I always felt like something is still missing. A feeling of guilt was always lingering in my heart.

One fine day it occurred to me that I am not a superman! I have a limited stock of energy which diminishes with the Sun going down. Besides that, there’s a constant assault on my resourcefulness by various factors outside of my control. In short, though I have 24 hours a day, I have much fewer hours in which I can be highly productive.

I have already been aware of and applying the well-established time management techniques like the 80/20 rule (Pareto’s principle), urgent vs. important, prioritizing your tasks, starting with the most challenging things first, etc. But something was missing. Somehow nothing was giving me peace of mind. With my headphones on, listening to focus@will tunes, shunned from external noises, I was deeply absorbed in thoughts, trying to understand why it’s not working for me. Finally, a little voice in my head told me to get up and get to actual work; you are wasting time. And then, I realized I had set unrealistic expectations for myself. No matter how ambitious I am, no matter how talented I am, there’s a limit to how much I can “produce” in a given time. And I also realized that even if I get 24 hours to work, I am restricted by the amount of energy I have. And then there was a Eureka moment! All the pieces of the puzzle fall in place. I immediately recorded my thoughts, and here is the framework that you can use to achieve your goals peacefully!

Here’s the first principle: Long-term planning is guesswork!

The future can’t be predicted with certainty. At the most, you can be sure of what will happen in the next few weeks. Long-term planning is guesswork. Long-term planning is not as relevant as it used to be because of faster technological change and increased competition in the market. In today’s dynamic environment, one needs to adapt quickly for survival and success.

Long-term planning may still play a role in strategic decision-making for big firms with dominant positions in their market segment. But for us, lets’ stick to a week.

Before planning your week, first, let’s find out your budget. How much time do you really have? Here, I want to make a distinction. Whenever you think about time, always remember that time is not a single entity as far as scheduling your tasks. Whenever you think about time, think about a specific time and your energy level at that time. We want to find out time slots wherein you have high energy, medium energy, and low energy. So even though you have got 24 hours a day, you have got a limited number of time-energy slots. When I say energy, it is physical as well as emotional energy. It is your overall state of mind and body. It is an indication of your resourcefulness which can predict the extent of your productivity. Now you have a meaningful and realistic inventory of time! Understand this, even if you have time, but if you are tired or are feeling sad, upset, or irritated, you can’t really put that time to good use.

Now, make a list of the goals you want to achieve this week. Exclude Sunday from the week. If you want you can have a five-day week. Here is my suggestion for choosing your goals for a week. Choose any five important categories of your life—for example, business, fitness, family, learning, and personal. Now choose exactly one goal from each category that you want to achieve. So, you will have one business goal, one fitness goal, one family goal, one learning goal, and one personal goal. Remember, just one goal from each category. Don’t be greedy; it’s just for a week! Next week you can choose different goals if you want. And that’s the beauty of this framework – freedom of making mistakes with no strings of guilt attached to your choice.

If you strictly follow this strategy, you will choose only the most important goals for a week. You will be ultra-focused. You will cut down the unnecessary crap. You will start saying no. Here I assume that your commitment and sincerity are as high as a teenager who wants to establish his identity in his pack! This step will also reveal what your real priorities are. You just have a week; you have to choose what you want to do, you can’t postpone essential things, you may not get another week! So, choose wisely.

The next step is to make a list of tasks needed to complete each goal. Then, sort the list into three categories: high energy tasks, medium energy tasks, and low energy tasks.

Now you are clear about what to do and what is the best time to do it! That’s it!!

If you want to be even more productive, you can select just one micro goal for a day and apply all of your energy to it. You need to avoid multitasking and just focus on one task at a time.

The side effect of using this framework is that you will realize it’s high time you quit a few things that are so dear to you. It will also help you recognize your actual responsibilities. Finally, it will also clear all the confusion about who you are and what’s your purpose!",o5kg2i,947,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/o5kg2i/plan_your_week_not_your_whole_life_get_unstuck/

37,Sometimes I feel like my brain wants to do ANYTHING to avoid doing the thing I have planned,"I have a certification exam next Saturday.

38,Being productive isn't about wasting less time - it's about getting the important stuff done.,"This is a pretty important distinction.

I think a mistake that we're tempted to make is to look at how much time we spend browsing Reddit, YouTube, or playing games and think ""Oh man, I should have been spending that time doing something better! I wasted all that time.""

It's a mistake because we're not looking in the right direction. Being productive isn't about wasting less time, it's about getting the important stuff done.

As long as you get the most important stuff done, it doesn't matter what else you do, does it?

Therefore it's a better idea to come into each day knowing exactly what needs to get done, and making sure to accomplish them. It's best to write it out as a list before getting into the next day.

If you focus, you can get the most important things done in a few hours, after which you can - and *should* \- waste as much time as you want.

You don't want to get greedy. It's possible that you can get all your work done in the morning and then start saying ""well then I should give myself more to do."" And maybe a little more is good, but if you keep filling up your schedule with more and more things to do, then there will be no time to actually enjoy your life, and then you'll get that self-sabotage-union-strike thing and everything breaks back down.

**Make sure that you come into each day knowing specifically what needs to get done, and then make sure you do it.** Bring your attention where it matters - as long as the things get done, it doesn't matter how many games you play. This is called enjoying your life!

39,Instead of thinking it will take a month or a year to change think about the 24 hrs you have.,"A lot of people including me think that five years from now I will be doing this and living like this. It is good to visualise and have affirmations but no one knows the tomorrow, we can visualise it or manifest it but unless we don't take the action today, the tomorrow won't come.

I think we need to focus on the 24 hrs rather than a month or two to see changes.

Have an end goal in mind but focus on today. You have 24 hrs to change your tomorrow and make it more predictable. 

Rather than thinking it will take a month or two to see the changes, think about today. Just the 24 hrs, forget everything   else.

The reason we procrastinate a lot is because we want to see quick changes and knowing it will take time will make us have second thoughts or just procrastinate more. Instead, just focusing on the 24 hrs allows us to see more changes quickly since a day passes quicker than a month. 

So if you workout today, get the project started today, etc. At the end of the day you can look and see the changes you made in your life within a day. Then next day again it starts from zero and again you put efforts and see the quick changes.

This will eventually lead to achieving the bigger changes and goals you want to achieve.",nps2fr,899,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/nps2fr/instead_of_thinking_it_will_take_a_month_or_a/
40,The one question that stops my procrastination,"Let me share the question that is changing my life. The question I keep asking myself several times a day. The question that saves me from mindless procrastination. The question that helps me be the best version of myself even when I don’t feel like it.

This question is

## “What’s the alternative? If not this, then what?”

Let me explain it using some real-life examples.

## Scenario #1

You have scheduled to work on an important project. Maybe it’s an essay for school or a report for work. You even put it on your schedule to work on it for two hours starting from 3 pm. It’s 2:55 pm and you are starring at this task, clearly not wanting to do it.

*Ugh. Not this again! Not today! Why me? Why now? Why do I always need to do these things? I don’t want to do it. It’s hard. I can do it tomorrow. What if I don’t do it at all? It’s unrealistic to finish it in one day. I’ll have more energy next week…* 

Sounds familiar?

And that’s when you ask yourself, “What’s the alternative?” meaning “If not this, then what?”.

Here is the secret.

Your brain already has a specific activity prepared for you to do when you decide to give up on your hard task. It has it ready. And you know it. **What is the activity your brain wants you to do instead of doing the work you have planned for yourself?** What will you do if you decide to skip doing the planned task? You already know what will be your next step. Let me guess…

* check Facebook
* check your email
* read news
* read sports news
* play a game on your phone
* browse social media
* watch videos on YouTube
* text friends in a group chat
* lie down on a couch and watch TV

Did I get it right?

Ok, it’s 2:55 pm. You look at your schedule and see “Complete Project X” scheduled from 3-5 pm. You start thinking all those thoughts but instead of indulging in them and letting them control you, all you need to do is to ask yourself, “**Ok, what’s the alternative? If not this, then what?**”

And this is where the magic happens. That’s when you catch a thief *before* he attempts to break into your house.

*– I don’t want to do it; it’s hard; I can do it tomorrow… yada yada.* 

*– Ok, what’s the alternative? If not this, then what?*

*– Go on Facebook or LinkedIn and just scroll… for the rest of the workday.* 

*– Umm… WHAT???*

*– Ooops, did I say it out loud? It was supposed to be a secret! \*Facepalm\**

And that’s how we catch a time thief before he breaks into the house.

When you ask yourself, “What’s the alternative?” you are not hiding from the truth. You already know what you are going to do once you decide to bail on the important task. You know. *You knoooow.* What’s your poison of choice? Facebook? News site? Twitter? Email?

**There is only one activity the lizard part of your brain wants you to do instead of working on Project X**. And it’s usually not something you would consciously choose to do.

## Scenario #2

You finish your work. You have your dinner. Ideally, you want to go for a long walk or go to the gym. That’s what you’ve planned for yourself. That’s what you’ve put on your new year’s resolutions list for… how many years now?

But…

*-Sigh. I’m tired. I had this difficult meeting at work. And that colleague of mine totally pissed me off. I don’t want to go for a walk…*

*– Ok, what’s the alternative? If not this, then what?*

*– Lie down on the couch and watch Netflix for the rest of the day. And let’s eat that bag of Cheetos while we are at it.*

When your brain is feeding you “I’m tired.. I don’t wanna do it” all it wants you to do is to cancel the activity you have planned and do the one activity it chose for you instead. It already knows the activity it wants you to do. It is picked, packed, and ready to be shipped. And you will do it on auto-pilot once you decide to cancel your plans.

The question of “What’s the alternative? If not this, then what?” reveals this activity. And once we uncover this activity we realize how silly and undesirable it is. Once we say it out loud. Once it’s out of the dark. It’s not something our conscious mind will ever choose to do. It’s not something we will ever put in our planner. We will never want to put it on our new year resolutions list. These activities usually happen on autopilot. We realize that we are doing them only *after* the fact. *After* we spent few hours on Instagram. *After* we binge-watched an entire season of a new show on Netflix. *After* we finish the whole bag of chips.

Our prefrontal cortex engages *after* this ‘lizard brain’ activity is complete. It analyses the damage. That’s when you feel a familiar bouquet of emotions: guilt, disgust, and disappointment. You are looking at the ruins of your day. The time thief came in, stole the valuable time and left.

When a student realizes the action the lizard brain is trying to get her to do is to spend hours on Facebook instead of writing an essay, her prefrontal cortex is in the position to say “No, I don’t want to waste hours observing other people’s lives. I would rather spend it creating the best life for myself by completing this assignment.”

## Conclusion

Whenever you feel a desire to procrastinate and bail on your own plan, the lizard part of your brain is trying to make you do a certain activity. It doesn’t want you to know what the activity is, it just wants you to not want to do an activity you have planned. It will give you a bunch of excuses of why you shouldn’t be doing that activity.

If you ask yourself “What’s the alternative? If not this activity, then what?” your lizard brain will reveal the activity it had prepared for you. And once you see that activity in daylight, hopefully, you will realize that it’s not something you want to *consciously* invest your time in. *Thanks but no thanks.*

41,Idk who needs to hear this but failure does not erase your progress.,"In taking exams or having job interviews, you either pass/get hired or fail/get rejected. But all of the processes you’ve gone through to prepare yourself for it are already Something (yeah with a capital S). Like screw it, as long as you tried your best to study/practice/get yourself ready you have already won. I’m not talking about half assed studying I’m talking about substantial efforts. That’s already victory if you really think about it because you tried everything you could do at the time. And that’s progress. Whether u gained knowledge or discipline or simply the feeling of accomplishment after trying your best, thats already a win. I mean if u were eating a really good pie but u were only able to finish half of it thats not gonna erase the fact that u finished half of it.

So yeah, hope this makes sense.",lnm3g7,898,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/lnm3g7/idk_who_needs_to_hear_this_but_failure_does_not/
42,You are probably overestimating the amount of tasks you can finish in one day,"Speaking from personal experience. Maybe this sounds familiar to others, too.

Warning: long post. TL;DR at the bottom.

So you spent three days procrastinating and avoiding work/studying/exercising/cleaning/etc. If you're like me, you'll probably start panicking after realizing that you're way behind with stuff you need to do. Therefore, you decide to make this long to do -list and have a productive day tomorrow.

Tomorrow arrives. You start your day early and stay productive until lunchtime. You have not finished all your tasks as they take more time than you thought they would. But you still have time left, so it's no problem.

Then something interrupts you. Maybe it's an unexpected email you need to respond ASAP, or you spend a little too much time on Instagram after your lunch break, or whatever. Now you're behind your schedule. You'll skip the next task and find yourself on Instagram or updating your inbox again. Your work schedule is ruined already, so you might as well do some mindless activities instead.

Oh it's 3 p.m.? Well, f\*ck it, there's always tomorrow. Let's move to chores and hobbies, then. You need to do the dishes after three days of procrastination. You have 10 mins before you need to head to the gym. However, turns out that the dishes take 30 mins to finish as there are so many dirty dishes. Okay, let's skip the gym today. Now you'll have some time to scroll through your social media feeds before moving to other tasks.

Now it's 6 p.m. You were supposed to do laundry but forget it as you're starting to feel guilty about being unproductive, again, and don't want to take a look at your to do -list anymore. Time to cook dinner. You had thought that it takes 15 mins but notice that there are a few ingredients missing. So you need to pick up some groceries or order takeout (you won't do anything productive while waiting because you're too hungry to focus on anything).

Another hour passes by. You decide to watch an episode of your favorite show while eating dinner. Actually, you watch two episodes. So you didn't hit the gym today and forgot to focus on other productive hobbies you have. You feel bad. Terrible. Yet another day is ruined. Why can't you get anything done? What is wrong with you? You head to the bed without showering and spend two hours scrolling Reddit before falling asleep. Tomorrow you'll get things done. Promise.

Well, what's the moral of the story? The key issue is that you *overestimate how productive you can be in one day*. If you're a procrastinator, you'll probably have many unfinished projects. In your illogical procrastinator mind you want to get it all done, preferably right now. But - as you're not used to productive days and, you know, normal human life (it's always all or nothing to you) - you *underestimate the time it takes to finish tasks.*

You're a wishful thinker. Well, some days you actually get many things done. But you don't see that those days do not represent your average day-to-day life. Interruptions and obstacles happen. Things break in the middle of something and your work laptop is f\*cking with you. Often, things don't go so smoothly or they just take more time than you thought. You can't keep up with your strict schedule.

What's the solution, then? You need to follow these three, easy steps:

1. Schedule your day or make a to do -list.
2. Take 2/3 tasks off or schedule 3x the time you initially planned for each task.
3. Do your tasks.

It's okay to not get it all done in one day, or one week, or a month. However, if you stick to your *realistic plans*, you'll notice that it gets easier to stay productive. You won't feel guilty or overwhelmed in front of your impossible task list. Therefore, you will not end up procrastinating, at least not as often as before. Maybe you will end up doing more and getting more things done. And if you don't, it's perfectly okay, too. Slow and steady progress towards your goals is what takes you there.

TL;DR: Less is more. Your tasks probably take three times more time to finish as you think. Stay realistic and aim towards slow and steady instead of super effective.",q10egu,887,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/q10egu/you_are_probably_overestimating_the_amount_of/
43,Learning to enjoy the process of your goals unfolding makes life 10 x more enjoyable,"When you are studying, or working hard, or running a business, etc. I hear everyone say ""enjoy the process"" but what does that actually mean? It means to be present and embrace the NOW. While we all want to reach that end goal eventually and we all want to be our best selves and accomplish our goals, when you embrace this idea of ""right now. I am here. I am enjoying being here. I am learning every day"" etc. Like being grateful for the new day even it just creates a whole shift, and you will really appreciate the work that you are doing.",m9cdip,883,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/m9cdip/learning_to_enjoy_the_process_of_your_goals/
44,A simple trick that eliminated my procrastination,"Procrastination frustrates me. I get work done but it's always at the end of the day. When I want to do something fun, I always feel guilt. Sucks when the sun is down most of the day.

After serious reflection & learning, I finally freaking figured it out. 

**Be kind to yourself.**

Sounds simple but incredibly hard to apply. We automatically have negative thought patterns and it gets worse with procrastination. Starting anything is tough -- even while writing this Reddit post, I observed negative thoughts coming out. 

Now, here's how you can really apply it. A small, simple trick -

**What's a small positive thought that I can easily generate right now?** It should be something specific about the task at hand. 

Let's say you have to finish a big essay. You really don't want to do it, it's hard, will take a long time, and it's due in 5 days. But you know you've gotta get a little bit done so you don't get screwed. So I propose ""**a pause**"". 

Your first task is to think about the task at hand in some positive manner. Even if it really sucks (lol), think about the big picture. **5 minutes, a piece of paper, and a pen.** Write or draw something positive that somehow connects to your task. If it gets you in a rhythm, you could: 

Draw, write, plan the project out, pseudocode, a small rough draft of the essay. You could even walk and think. Do whatever! You deserve it, you're about to do something incredible -- produce quality work & learn.

On the Tim Ferriss show, Jerry Seinfeld explained, ""*One of the most difficult things there is, way harder than weight training, way harder, what you’re summoning, trying to summon within your brain and your spirit, to create something onto a blank page.*”

Doing work is hard for everyone. The trick is to seriously encourage yourself -- 1 positive thought to 1 positive action. Then, who knows, you might finish everything :)

45,“Atomic Habits” - my insights from the book,"The 20 or so most important insights i got from the book [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits) are given below. It’s a really amazing book that has massively helped me in my life, i hope you guys can take a lot from it too now even if you don't read it yourself.

I’ve also put the insights + others into a [deck](https://saveall.ai/shared/deck/17&4&eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJvd25lciI6NCwiZGVja19pZCI6MTd9.oYROKg2MgHZSAa-dP-MOx_sLtzhExrJo_R2AguuhbwYhaFv3baDOKYYMzDU_71AUMjoi5MqUj8VjZ1yAmDsZIiojwvSBAjy7CfkO6M7PrZhysZ06oE5-9353rCJXyg76jqi49GYXH_FaMp81lfcHXaIqhP47U30D95okgU3rncoWlIqSI3j_BkwPtO5GlFW1ijl1O3J1O5wbHQqyNO80du2mI0CBR_78hPd8-DfASD15TIDuwDo9PW7pfuETRxXkXXw8fWLVILTMctnWtbKBLfJwSeO-Z5BCH4awwhnYOMhyLEIBYNbKYyIVoHNH-X0XwgbzgqWnByBCZzTuerQLBA) on save all (a memory app that helps you remember things) in case you want help remembering them. here are the insights:

&#x200B;

* **Each time** you **successfully do a habit** you **will find it less effortful to do next time**
* So the **most important thing** is to **make it as easy as possible to START a new habit.** Then you will start benefiting from the **powerful compounding effect**: you do the habit, it becomes easier to do, you do the habit some more, it becomes even easier to do and so on…

&#x200B;

**Making it easy to START habits:**

* Best way is to **make sure it only takes 2 minutes to begin with**. You can increase the time later, e.g. start off by reading 2 minutes a day, then when the habit is solidified increase it to 5 minutes etc...
* **Habit Stacking** \- this is when you attach a new habit to some pre-existing habits you already do. e.g. if you want to create the new habit of reading 2 minutes a day, and you already have the habit of eating breakfast every morning, then schedule your new reading habit to happen just after you finish breakfast. I’ve found stacking habits like this helps me massively
* If you can, **try and join a group of people** who are **already doing the habit.** e.g. if you want to exercise more then join a football club. We are tribal people and so linking in some way to others who do something makes us much more likely to do it ourselves

&#x200B;

**Best ways to STICK to habits** once you’ve started them:

* **Reward yourself after completing the habit**. This gives you a dopamine hit which means you will be more likely to do the habit again next time, this works even though you know what is happening!
* Use **commitment devices** if you can e.g. if you want to stop going on some websites then install a chrome plugin that literally blocks you going on them. Setting public goals that you tell lots of people about can also act as a good commitment device
* If you can, have an **accountability partner**
* If you can, **pick habits that align with your natural abilities** as they will be easier to maintain
* **Ritualise the start of a habit** to minimise the thinking required to start the habit and so therefore make it less effortful
* **Reduce friction for good habits**, e.g. leave your gym shorts out overnight if you want to go to the gym in the morning. e.g. put an app you want to use on the first screen of your phone not on later screens. 

&#x200B;

**Best ways to STOP doing bad habits:**

* **Reduce exposure** to the **CUE** of the bad habit, e.g. if you want to stop smoking and you’ve noticed you always smoke when drinking a coffee in your garden then stop drinking coffee in your garden (that’s the cue). Note that Time and Location are the 2 most common cues.
* It is **MUCH easier to avoid temptation than to resist it** so if you can just **avoid situations where you know you will be tempted**
* **Increase friction for bad habits** e.g. if you want to stop eating all the chocolate then make sure the chocolate is kept in a hard to reach place rather than somewhere that is easy to get to
* **Punish yourself after doing a habit you want to stop** e.g. everytime you smoke decide to throw away $5 afterwards so that the smoking was made more painful to you

46,[The No-Scroll Method] What I learned after wasting 3 hours every day on social media for 2 years.,"I watched an average of  3 hours of YouTube  PER DAY for the last 2 years. It didn't ""ruin my life"", but it certainly made life difficult in some sense. Recently, I realized what really kept me in the YouTube rabbit hole for hours on end every day...

I just kept scrolling.

I scrolled through the homepage to find a video that caught my attention, I scrolled through the comments while the video was playing. I scrolled everywhere!

I noticed that social media apps and websites promote one thing: **scrolling**.

And if you just stop scrolling, you'll save precious time that you can spend, doing anything better than scrolling, like talking to the cute girl that's in front of you in the grocery shop.

Here's how to implement it:

Whenever you open a social media app, take one second and think why did you actually open the app. Do you want to pass time? Are you trying to escape some thoughts? Or are you just putting off important work? 

Don't judge your answer, even if you know you are procrastinating. 

Now that the intention is clear and you still want to use the app/website, I want you to implement one rule: 

**Don't scroll on the homepage!**

You can scroll on your profile page or your watch later playlist or your saved Reddit posts, but you cannot scroll on the homepage of the app or the website.

You might think that it defeats the purpose of social media, but it's not like that.

We often save some amazing videos on Watch Later or some great articles on Reddit saves, but we don't go through them because they are often longer and more boring than cat videos.

This method has helped me save literal hours and I've been accomplishing a lot more. 

**IMPORTANT: Cut yourself some slack!**

All of the major social media platforms are spending millions of dollars to make people waste time, so you need to have some compassion for yourself if you do realize that you've been spending hours scrolling on Instagram because after all, it is you vs. a multi-billion dollar industry.

So please don't get depressed if you catch yourself during a cat video binge. It is okay.

49,start by fixing your sleep before you try to improve any other areas of your life because sleep is the foundation upon which you can build productivity!,"i am a resident doctor in canada and i recently had a 3 week work stretch (in obstetrics) where i had to work 5 24h shifts in 3 weeks + regular 10 hour work days. In totally i worked 189h in the delivery room, which is 63 h /week or 12.6h/day. In those 24h shfits, i get on average 0-1h of sleep.

i knew this was going to be brutal going in, so i made a commitment: im going to focus on one thing and one thing only , and that was my sleep. I made sure to get 8-9 h of sleep every single night that i was sleeping at home. the results were subtle but truly impressive

1. thanks to my impeccable sleep, i recovered quicker from the 24h sleep deprivation and i felt so energetic on days where i was not working 24h. as a result, i went on runs 2-3 times a week and was able to ramp up my training. at the end of my rotation, i completed a HALF MARATHON UNDER 2 hours (i was already a long distance runner, so this was not from 0 to 100) which was a personal record for me
2. by prioritizing my sleep, i reduced time spent on social media which was SO MIND LIBERATING. i felt lighter emotionally, i had more energy and life just felt less stressful.

here is a video where i talked more in detail

51,Is a 4-day workweek the answer to employee burnout? Most American workers say yes,"The remedy may be a four-day workweek, according to a survey from Eagle Hill Consulting.

Of those U.S. employees polled, 53% said they are experiencing burnout, with women and younger workers showing the highest levels, at 56% and 62% respectively. Fully 83% said a shortened workweek would help. The survey included 1,010 respondents from a random sample of employees across the U.S.

“Employee burnout has been simmering for years — and the twin problems of the pandemic and workforce shortage have exacerbated the problem,” said Melissa Jezior, president and CEO of Eagle Hill Consulting.

While not new, the idea of a four-day workweek has slowly been gaining ground since the Covid-19 pandemic struck. In July, Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., introduced a bill that reduces the standard workweek to 32 hours, from 40.",qvdau7,808,80,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/qvdau7/is_a_4day_workweek_the_answer_to_employee_burnout/
52,"""Just Do It"" is the most underrated advice ever","imagine procrastinating a project for a month because I didn't find the set of ""Productivity tools"" I want..... yeah, that's me.

I did waste a month doing nothing, true, however, I did notice a pattern.

every time I tried to implement a new productivity method, my brain will be like ""Nah I don't like it.

I've literally spent hours and hours searching for apps, websites and when it comes the time to start, my brain will be like ""I'm sure I can find another app or method because you know I don't feel motivated enough"" and the cycle continues.

so last week I realized how stupid this mindset was, searching for apps to be motivated and letting my brain take control over me won't get me anywhere, so, I said to my self ""Screw this"" I deleted all those ""Productivity tools"" and  I left for my self a copybook and that's it and I said to my self ""just get moving, what's the worst that can happen"" and after just 3hours of working, I never felt happier because I came to a realization that **motivation comes after working, productivity yields more productivity.**

so what to take away from this: don't even give your brain the time or energy to even think of procrastination because the moment you do, the chain will become stronger, and please remember the only obstacle you have now is STARTING, after that motivation will come by itself.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: we constantly overcomplicate the concept of ""productivity"", thinking that we need fancy tools, tricks, and apps to feel motivated, but ""Just Do It"" is hands down the most superior approach not because it's so simple and gets our feet wet but because it's the only method of which we can to say to  our brain ""Shut up""

53,I Did 16 Habits Every Day for 60 Days,"Hey friends, my life over the past year has increasingly been built around habit tracking. Since February last year, I've been posting monthly updates on /r/theXEffect. My last post is here:(to be posted) which leads into a rabbit hole for all of my updates. I just had my first two months in a row of 100% and wanted to share some things that have helped me. The habits are:

* Bed by 11 pm
* Work Out
* Nutrition
* Walks
* Stretching
* Meditate
* Journal
* 2 Hours of Deep Work
* 3 Hours on Personal Projects
* Piano
* Music Reading
* Inbox Zero x 3
* Improvement
* Good Deed
* Reading
* Shutdown Ritual

Going into what each of these habits means would make this post too long, but I've detailed the habits and their benefits in a video I made [**I Did 16 Habits Every Day For 16 Days.**](https://youtu.be/MpbPD7GDlX8) Atomic Habits is what made me start on Habit Tracking and I, so if you want to get better at habits and have not read it I 100% recommend it. The most important things for me have been:

### Track and share

As mentioned, I post monthly updates on /r/theXEffect, and for me, this a complete game-changer. Now it's no longer about doing arbitrary things for an endless period. I'm focused on specific tasks for a specific period, and I have an excuse to share my progress with the world. Posting on reddit also gives me an easier way to share it with others in my life which increases my accountability. 

### Start Small

Don't just start with 16 habits. The goal is to build consistency. When I started out, I had 3 habits I tracked, and they were already things I was regularly doing. The approach is not to put as many habits on your plate as you can imagine and ""force"" yourself to get more done. Start by highlighting things you already think you can do consistently, then slowly expand that circle. 

### Lower barrier for success

Every day is not going to be great, and you are not going to be feeling great every day, so build room for that. For me, this most often comes up with working out. Optimally, I work out for 1.5 hours and try to push my limits, but I've noticed my energy has started to wane over the past few weeks. Instead of skipping, I give myself some room to breathe and just do a 20-30 minute workout with much lighter weights. 


Similarly, I don't think anyone should aim for 100% all the time. It's good to take days off. The gold standard for me (which I am still far from reaching), is that the days I take off are days I've decided in advance. I don't like skipping things just because I feel low energy at that specific day, but I'll happily take the next few days completely off habit tracking for easter and feel no guilt about it because it's a decision I've made.

### Rituals / Habit Stacks

There is one state of mind you want to avoid at all costs when it comes to your habits: You are currently doing something easy and rely on your willpower to push you out of the comfort zone and start doing something hard. Not only does this have a pretty high chance of failing, but the period where you are trying to push yourself to do something is the absolute worst. It feels boring and guilty, and on a bad day, it can easily just suck up the entire day. 


What you want is that the harder things happen without thinking, directly after something else. This could be a specific ritual you do before, like taking a walk before you start to work, some specific part in your day like always working out after work. It can also just be a specific time.


You want to work towards a place of no ifs or buts. When the specific time comes, you start regardless of your motivation levels. If your motivation level is low, you can tell yourself it's OK to quit if you just start it or do the easiest version possible. 


### Internalise Why Habits Matter

This is something I think about regularly. The important part of building a habit is not just ""doing the thing"" or getting a specific result. The goal of building a habit is to change who you are. If you only think about working out to get ripped, then the days where you are not feeling energized, you might just skip beause you know it will be a light workout and not worth doing. Every day you stick to your habit of working out, even if it's just taking a 5-minute walk around the block, that aligns you towards becoming a person who works out regularly. And if you skip, it has the opposite effect; you are more likely to skip workouts in the future.


I did not expect this post to become this long, but I guess I have a lot to say on habits 🙈.

54,Don't be afraid to take a nap in the middle of the workday - they can make you more productive.,"Benefits of different nap lengths:

1. 10-20 Minute: Helps with a quick energy boost and improved alertness.
2. 30-40 Minute: Increases concentration, alertness, creativity and mood. A 40 minute nap taken by pilots and astronauts in flight, also known as the “NASA nap,” improved performance by 34%.
3. 60 Minute: Improves memory for faves, names, and facts. Downside of this nap is that you might feel groggy when you wake up, so it might take some time to recover from.
4. 90 Minute: Improves emotional and procedural memory and creativity. Since 90 minutes is the amount of time it takes to undergo a full sleep cycle, you won’t feel groggy like you would from a 60 minute nap.",o06xvy,777,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/o06xvy/dont_be_afraid_to_take_a_nap_in_the_middle_of_the/

I’m sure I’ve just described what a majority of people deal with day to day, but I really want to make the change.

What strategies do people use to avoid burning out after work?",mu2jwu,752,103,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/mu2jwu/how_do_you_maintain_energy_and_motivation_after/
59,"If you procrastinate too much, then just focus on matching your WORD with your ACTION","This is just a simple, little trick that should help you get back into action. This is for you if:

\- You consider yourself to be ambitious, gifted, or otherwise with tons of unrealized potential    
\- You are not acting or living in such a way that serves this unrealized potential

The problem is that you have all these dreams, ideas, and visions. You can see them, you know they're real, you know you can make all of this happen... but you don't! And because you don't your wheels are just spinning in the mud, but you're not actually moving forward in any way.

In other words, there's no connection anymore between your **word** and your **action**. Bring these two things back in relationship, and you'll start regaining momentum in your life.

# How it works

The big mistake that most people make is that they'll try either to  

1) Do too much all at once, or    
2) Give up on themselves before they even try.

In the first case, you're using your word to make too many promises that you can't follow through on, and in the second case, you're not using your word at all - so you're not giving yourself anything to do!

In this post though, I'm suggesting a *third* method which is to give yourself something small - but important - to do, and get it done. This feels like getting a win after a LONG procession of failures. It feels like ""ah! I can actually do this!"" It feels like encouragement.

... Now you have something that you can actually build upon.

# How to use this tool

If you're reading this at the beginning of the day, then choose a single thing that you can do that would move you toward your highest ambtion/priority. Choose something that you could do in 30 minutes or less.

When you choose this task, define it so that you know when it's done. For example, don't say ""I'm going to work on my business"", say ""I'm going to follow up with 5 leads.""

# Let this one thing be enough, for now.

The biggest thing to avoid is the trap of ""This isn't a big enough challenge, I'm capable of so much more! How pitiful it is that I can only do this one little thing!""

Avoid this thinking. In order to match your *word* with your *action,* you need to meet yourself where you are right now. Let this little task be enough for now - *and then give yourself something more challenging tomorrow*.

This way you can find exactly where your limitations are, and you can begin to push them outward from there.

# TL;DR:

If you procrastinate too much, get yourself a quick win today. Give yourself one important - but small - task that you will do today. *Do* this task. Re-establish connection between what you do, and what you *say* you'll do. This will give you new energy, new momentum. You'll be ready to take on more.

Hope this helps!

60,A guide to being productive,"# TL;DR: The things you do not want to do. Do them. Right now. Build a sense of duty. Sleep, eat and rest well. Think positively about yourself & fix your mistakes constructively, not destructively.

# Foreword

I am not a doctor of any kind, just some guy who became disciplined about a year ago and who read a whole lot about lifting heavy objects. I wish to share my journey of becoming disciplined because I am tired of seeing my friends wasting away in self-contempt because they do not get enough done. If the guide contains any spelling and/or grammar mistakes, feel free to correct me. This also counts for factually incorrect statements. I do not wish to spread misinformation. That being said, let’s get started.

**The big Why**

So, you’ve decided to get disciplined. I am sure you will stop after the first few obstacles if you do not have an unshakeable answer to the following question: ‘Why do I want to get disciplined?’ The answer may be a hard one, but to truly stick to your new way of living you should have an ironclad reason to truly become disciplined. I have listed out the reasons why I decided to become disciplined.

**Preventing depression**

If you are disciplined, you are pursuing a goal you are giving your life to (why else would you want to build your day to be the most productive it can get?). This sense of direction alone can help prevent depression and other such disorders, regardless of what you are striving for. In addition, becoming disciplined often also involves chasing a career in something other than work or school, which may give you a sense of belonging or duty.

**Quality of life for the future you**

You have probably already heard of the Theory of the Three You’s: the past You, the present You and the future You. If you want to achieve the best possible outcome for the future You, the present You should go out of its way to do nice acts for the future You. This may include studying in advance, but it can also include long-term things like preventing joint pain for the elderly You through sports, preventing cognitive decline for the elderly You through books and preventing the elderly You from dying too soon by eating healthier.

**It creates time for the actually important things**

You’ve decided to become disciplined and you probably have a good reason for that. You want to enter that prestigious college, you wish to get this much sought-after job and so on. If you are disciplined, you have the self-control to set aside time for the matters in your life you actually care about.

**Fulfillment**

Another simple reason you might want to improve yourself is that you simply enjoy the journey of progressing in life, so you are indirectly looking for happiness.

**If not this then what?**

This one may be a little specific, but this reason actually resounded within me a lot. If you do not dedicate your life to the things you want to improve, what do you want to do else? Be sad because you do not get enough things done? Waste the whole day on your phone watching Youtube?

# Physiological changes

For me, the physiological changes to my schedule (actually getting a consistent sleep schedule, a complete overhaul of my diet and lifting) were the easiest to implement, that is why I put them first.

# Sleep

Sleep of high quality is the single most important aspect of your life to change, partially because it is the easiest. Sleep, among other highly important things, alleviates stress, improves mental and physical acuity and decreases the risk of contracting several diseases.

Now we have covered this, we have to get an important misconception out of the way: if you are currently sleeping 5 hours a night **you are probably not one of those people who do not need a lot of sleep**. To know if this is actually the case, you should try to sleep 8-9 hours and see if your productivity increases.

**Regularity**

Your body loves consistency. This love of consistency is no different if sleep is concerned: for the best quality of sleep and for the lowest amount of time to fall asleep you should sleep on a consistent basis for a consistent time. For example, I sleep from 22.30-07.30 on weekdays and on the weekend I sleep from anywhere between 22.00-23.00 to anywhere between 08.00-08.30.

**Winding down**

Taking it easy before going to bed improves the quality of sleep. That is why you should do a relaxing activity (such as reading) before sleep that does not include screen use. If you really have to, you should do so with a screen filter app, such as Twilight.

**Darkness**

Falling asleep is much easier in a pitch-black room. If this is impossible to achieve, you could buy a cheap sleeping mask to cover your eyes while you sleep.

**Cut out sounds**

External stimuli like sound can keep you awake. If you are unable to sleep in a completely soundless environment, you should use some wax earbuds to cancel out sounds.

**Writing down thoughts before bed**

If you are troubled by annoying thoughts or things you should memorise when you go to sleep you should write those thoughts down before bed, for example in a journal.

# Nutrition

Sleep is a great way to alleviate stress. For optimal health, however, you also need to eat the best possible food choices. If your current goal is to lose fat, you have to **eat less calories than you actually need**. I recommend removing 300-400 calories from the amount of calories you need. This has a nice balance between losing fat and maintaining muscle, if you consume protein according to the guidelines below. To build muscle mass in the quickest way possible, you have to **eat more than you need**. I recommend a surplus of 200 calories to prevent too rapid weight gain while simultaneously almost maxing out your muscle building capabilities. It is that simple. To know how many calories you need, you can probably find a table or formula on the internet.

**Protein**

Proteins are the building blocks of your body, as you have probably already heard. Since lean tissue (muscle mass) is mainly made up of 2 components, protein and water, you have to consume a lot of these nutrients. 1 g/kg of bodyweight for non-lifters, 1.6 g/kg if you want near-optimal muscle building capabilities and 2.2 g/kg if you want optimal muscle building. Try and space these in 3-6 meals a day, whatever suits you best. Remember, to build muscle, you have to train, sleep and eat well. If you remove or reduce any of the 3, your muscle building capabilities will suffer greatly.

**Fat**

Fats have gained a whole lot of negative attention in the mainstream media for the last couple of years. They are the bane of every person trying to be healthy, apparently. This is not completely true; fats keep you warm, they build cell membranes and improve bone density. For the purposes of lifting, however, they are not that important, and should be kept at 0.3 g/kg of bodyweight. Most of this should be unsaturated fats, and very little saturated and trans fats should be allowed in your diet.

**Carbohydrates**

Carbs are the preferred energy source for your body. They are stored in the muscles in the form of glycogen to be used when being physically active. Because carbs can be burned much easier than fats or proteins, they are mainly used when lifting, and thus the rest of the calories you eat (if you subtract the amount of calories acquired when eating proteins and fats from your total amount of calories) should be made up of carbohydrates.

**Micronutrients**

The nutrients we discussed before are called macronutrients because you need a whole lot of them. You need far less micronutrients. These micronutrients can be vitamins and minerals.

Pop quiz!

Why are certain types of food called ‘healthy’ and others ‘unhealthy’?

1. because foods are intrinsically healthy or unhealthy
2. because ‘healthy’ foods have a much better macronutrient composition
3. because unhealthy foods lack micronutrients

3 here is the correct answer. Some ‘healthy’ foods like brown bread are preferred to white bread, not because they have a much lower amount of calories or a much higher amount of protein, but because they contain less sugar and more micronutrients. This makes the food respectively cause less craving and makes it more nutrient-dense, and this is also why people prefer whole foods over processed foods.

**The importance of lifting (or any other hobby you love)**

Fitness, for me, was a novel concept; I thought I would never be inside the church of iron. Well, there I was, one and a half years ago, in the gym for the first time. Lifting is, besides fun and healthy, a great source of tools needed for self-improvement, such as self-esteem, habit-building and self-control. It also exposes how much personal growth is a tender plant that needs watering often, with only small increases in the amount. Lifting also builds patience, which is probably the most important characteristic you need for self-improvement. The reason why lifting is such an excellent source of discipline is twofold: first, you love it and that is why you persist; secondly, because you persist and make memories, you come to love it more.

# The mental game

**Dopamine & different forms of gratification**

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is concerned with the reward center in your brain. This substance may be released when completing a task, but more often than not it is released when browsing social media such as Reddit. (Sound familiar? :D) While browsing social media is fun and all, it adds nothing to your day and thus should be avoided. This is one of the reasons why people decide to quit social media. This instant gratification curve is a vicious cycle, because it fuels procrastination; you do not feel like doing something so you procrastinate, which makes you feel guilty but you cover this guilt by procrastinating and so on. In summary, you should try to avoid instant gratification, because they will drag you down in a vicious cycle of procrastination, while having no intrinsic value. Delayed gratification, however, will add something to your day and it will give fulfillment, even more than instant gratification.

**Cutting out negative thoughts**

‘You are what you think’

* Ralph Waldo Emerson

Negative thoughts can make an otherwise great day the worst day of your life. I will describe a few methods that stop negative thinking below.

The easiest way is to simply filter your mind for all the good things you see, and only think of these. If you want to download something but it does not succeed through one technical error or another, see it as a challenge and a way to improve your computer skills.

What may hold you up are toxic people, because the people around play a great role in how you perceive yourself.

You might also consider meditating, or simply clearing your mind out for a few minutes, when you notice negative emotions or thoughts are filling your mind.

A niche way to prevent negative thinking, especially in stressful moments, is rehearsing a mantra of some sorts. I try to reiterate the poem ‘If-’ by Rudyard Kipling.

**Comparing yourself to others**

When I was in middle school, there was this kid who did very little for school and still aced most tests. While I was more the ‘only-gets-good-grades-if-he-studied’ nerdy kid, I still irrationally put him on a pedestal and followed in his footsteps. This behaviour is partially responsible for the sudden crash of my grades halfway through my middle school career.

Comparing yourself to others was (at least for me) a fairly normal occurrence. However, this does not mean it is a good thing. More often than not, you will end up, like me, comparing yourself with those who are better than you, which makes you feel weak, dumb and less than you actually are. Furthermore, you feel like you should be just like them, simply because they are better; this is fundamentally a stupid idea. You might, as a novice lifter, compare yourself to an elite athlete and follow their training program. If you follow in someone else’s footsteps who is better than you, the only result will be an injury. Also, you might, in an attempt to copy them, take over their negative traits, so simply said, comparing yourself to others should never happen.

The only time you could do it is when the other person is about on the same level as you are, and then again, it would likely only breed bad blood or disappointment.

**Stopping procrastination**

Two methods of stopping procrastination worked for me: the 5 second rule and the 5 minute rule.

In the 5 second rule, you count to 5 and then you immediately do the act you actually have to do, like getting out of bed, going to the gym or getting back to work. I got this method from the book ‘The 5 second rule’ by Mel Robbins.

The second method is the 5 minute rule: the idea is that you simply commit to working 5 minutes and see how it goes from there. 5 minutes of work isn’t hard at all, and that way you can trick your brain into working for a longer period of time. After applying these two methods for a couple of months, I used most of the time I usually spent procrastinating productively.

As a sidenote, do not ever even think about procrastinating, as you will enter a vicious cycle of guilt. Only relax during pre-planned periods.

**Motivation vs. discipline**

Most people on this subreddit regard motivation as an inferior driver for success. While this is true, I do perceive motivation as important; it will help you when discipline fails and it will also help you if you are just starting out, because you have not yet built any real discipline. The problem with motivation is that it is an *external* drive factor; you cannot rely on this, because external effects will not always be there, but discipline, an *internal* drive factor, will. This is why people who were only motivated because of their parents (me) became C-students after they found out our grades did not really matter until high school (and I have learned even then they do not *really* matter), because we were only externally driven.

**Staying on track on the long term**

We can all agree that the long term is more important than the short term. Keeping to your goals is far more difficult in the long term, however. I have found three ways or ‘hacks’ if you want to call it so. The first one is learning to forgive yourself. Forgiving yourself relieves guilt and prevents you from starting a cycle of procrastination to try and relieve this guilt. What could you do instead of forgiving yourself? The time to change what you have done has already passed, so you might as well forgive, relieve the guilt and move on. To prevent yourself from making the same mistake again, you should not forget, which is best done by a journal, which is described below. The second way is talking positively about certain events. You do not want to hit the gym? Well, isn’t going to the gym an egoistic way to get a pump? If dread starts to kick in about something you will have to do, you have to have a certain calming inner voice that makes you do what you have to do. This inner voice can be created by deliberately talking positively for a longer period of time. The final way is simply planning more ‘unproductive’ activities in your day, such as reading and meditating. While applying these kinds of methods, you can work hard while simultaneously preventing a burnout.

**Dealing with setbacks**

Nobody likes setbacks, but we all will have to deal with them, some time or another. I will list out a few ways in which you can bounce back from defeat.

**Never get angry at anyone for your loss**. There are two problems that arise if you do: you will get people mad at you and you will never learn the lesson. The first one is obvious and needs no explanation. The second problem is a bit more complex. If you blame someone else for your defeat, like I once did with my physics teacher, I never got better, because I had a non-constructive mindset and because I could not ask help because I did not like him and he did not like me. Instead of learning from my failure, I got hopeless and angry and blamed everyone but me. After realising your failure is your fault, however, you have to be able to forgive yourself quickly and move on.

# Lessons I learned

**Journaling**

For a very long time, I scoffed at the idea of journaling. Now, after I discovered the profound effect of keeping a journal, I am grateful I forced myself to start. A journal is basically a book that keeps track of how your day went. This started as a purely lift-focused booklet, but now I keep track of my whole day and label certain activities as good or bad. This gives you a framework and a sort of graph of how you’re improving, which is intrinsically motivating. It also allows yourself to improve your weak points, because all the mistakes you make are on a single piece of paper. In addition, it can also be used as a central planner. Furthermore, it also allows you to reduce or at least regulate your negative emotions.

**Quit bad habits before it is too late**

I cannot stress this enough. If you mess up your lifting technique consistently, for example, you will have to spend double that amount of time fixing your mistakes. This also counts for all other mistakes you make in your life. Quitting smoking is immensely harder when you have already started it.

**Starting small**

You’ve probably already heard this quote a million times, but Rome wasn’t built in a day. Its vast empire was built with a great many setbacks and a few close calls. Do not beat yourself up if you do not complete something, simply make a realistic goal and stick to it. The size of the step you can take should increase over time. I read a post some time ago that compared getting disciplined with a rocket. If you are rock bottom, you first have to supply fuel and other small improvements to your rocket. Then, when all that is supplied, the hardest part is lifting off; actually getting started with the things you want to do. Then, when you are in the stratosphere, it becomes a little easier than when you are in the troposphere and so on.

**Put away your phone**

One of the biggest hindrances to my progress was my phone. The modern smartphone is a source of instantly gratifying activities. Thus, you should minimise the amount of distractions on your phone, if you want to keep it at all. This can be done by deleting or deactivating social media, Youtube and games. Your phone should be a reminder of discipline; you should keep a few books on it, notes and music, and nothing more. Even if you do so, you should never keep your phone with you when you are working.

**Becoming process-driven**

Well, you’ve come this far. That means that you are either really dedicated to acquiring something or you really love the grind (or both). If you are only in the first party, however, it is important that you come to appreciate all the hard work that goes into becoming disciplined. When I started, I was primarily result driven and quickly burnt out. Now, even during an exam week for school, I end up being motivated throughout the whole week, simply because I like to outgrind people who did not study.

**The Pomodoro technique**

What really made my productivity:mental fatigue ratio skyrocket was the Pomodoro technique. The basic idea is that you work for 25 minutes and rest for 5 minutes. You repeat this for 4 times, after which you take a break for 15 minutes. To allow myself to lift, I often work for 50 minutes and rest for 5 minutes, so I ‘save’ 5 minutes and I can lift after 8 such sessions, because then I have around 70 minutes to lift, which is enough for the most time.

# Closing thoughts

* Be an overall better person; think about yourself: ‘Do I want myself to have me around?’
* Reading a self-help book after waking up is a great reminder to remain disciplined throughout the day.
* A great many products, such as coaches, might seem expensive at first, but they are worth the investment, as you won’t have to think about that topic ever again.
* Eat the pain right now.
* ‘You can do anything you set your mind to’ is not true, but that does not mean you should not strive to get as good as possible in the facets of life that matter to you.
* The threat to progress (fat loss in this case) is not the day where you eat 1000 calories too much, but all the days you eat 100 calories too much.
* Improving social skills is quintessential to happiness in the long term.

61,Learn to distinguish between procrastination and lack of clarity about what needs to be done,"I use to beat myself up about not pursuing things that I actually wanted to be doing, I was motivated and wanted to see things through, so why wasn't I doing them. I thought I was procrastinating, so I derided myself as lazy and slothful and all the rest of it.

That was really counter productive. It ignores the actual reason I wasn't starting projects or doing things, and as such didn't remedy them.

#I was *not* procrastinating: I simply didn't know how to proceed.

Procrastination is when there's a pile of dishes in the sink and because it's boring you don't want to do it. You know how to wash dishes. In fact the familiar banality of it is perhaps what makes you more loathe to do it.
Procrastination is when you need to remove a band-aid but because it hurts you don't do it right away. You know how to remove it, it just hurts.

However take something like filling in an application, or perhaps writing a screenplay - why wasn't I doing these things? And I've come to realize it's often because I was uncertain about the best means to proceed. I don't know what the people reading the application want or what will work.
Some will say ""oh, that's just a fear of failure"" - but my experience has taught me it's a Cassandra Prophecy ! of failure. The things I'm uncertain about doing which cause me to pseudo-procrastinate are the things that if I leapt into them and did them I would do wrong. I would indeed fail.

The problem is if you simply label it ""procrastination"" you're going to guilt yourself into starting it prematurely, do it wrong, then feel like a real idiot because you did it wrong.

I do this all the time when I'm cooking dinner, I often am so eager to start cooking my pasta sauce I forget to bring the pasta pot to the boil so they aren't finished at the same time, so I end up with a lukewarm sauce. Or worse, I may FORGET A VITAL INGREDIENT!
If I had of taken the time to think, why do I feel something is missing... what is Casandra telling me... I'd have something delicious. Maybe a fear of failure is because it's a legitimate fear, sometimes?

I have a example about a screenplay I wrote earlier this year, I had it outlined - but the outline sucked. But because I thought I was 'procrastinating' I went and wrote the screenplay. And it sucked because the outline sucked, and I learned nothing and had to trash the whole thing. If I had of listened to the Cassandra within me telling me ""AlcibiadesCape, you're not ready to write that script. Work on the outline more..."" instead of listening to all the bullshit platitudes saying ""just write it"" ""you got this king"" ""you just need to start"" I would have delivered a first draft that of course wouldn't be perfect, of course would still need work - BUT, it would have been something that would suggest where i could progress instead of being a irredeemable pile of crap.

Now you're mad if all you take away from this post is ""I'm not lazy and procrastinating, my inner Cassandra is just telling me I'm not ready"" as a way of justifying not doing anything.

#What you should be doing is firstly determining do you in fact know what needs to be done but just don't want to do it, or are you hesitant to start because of uncertainty.

#If it's the former, then yes, DO IT! If it's the latter, then you have an even harder task ahead of you - you now need to figure out just what the heck you should be doing so you can remove this hesitation and feel confident about starting...

My apologies, I don't have a strategy to combat that. That's the next insight I would like to realize.
I hope this post helps some of you

63,About to lose my job because of a bird,"So I'm an IT project manager who's been working remotely for a year because of covid19. Being at home never stopped me from being productive. In fact, I like to think it actually increased my productivity since I no longer have to walk from one meeting to another thanks to MS Teams. 

Here's the kicker. Two weeks ago I started to notice that there was a bird that kept coming back to my balcony. The reason I noticed this is because my desk sits right next to a patio door that leads to my balcony, that way I can see outside when I'm working and it provides me with adequate natural lightning. This got me curious so I started peaking and realized he was building a nest with his SO. Now, I could have intervene, but honestly I got mesmerized by it. I'm telling you, that bird is sooooo cute and whenever it sing, which is all the time, it's like the most beautifully melody ever. I tried to continue my work but could not help myself, I HAD TO peak constantly at that magnificent creature and my work started to accumulate as a result. That was two weeks ago. 

It's not all though, because I had a beautiful suprise waiting for me on Tuesday : chicks! Awww god! Fuck me.. If the two parents were cute, they don't even compare to those chicks. They are so small and so fluffy and they just chill in their nest all day long making as much noise as possible with their tiny mouth until mom and dad comes back with worms in their mouth. They have these tiny black eyes which looks at me whenever Im working and they only stop singing when I look back at them. I think they consider me as their fun uncle or something. I don't know what they are yet but I have spend a great deal of time researching on the web for their species. I even missed an important meeting so I could go buy some seeds for the Papa bird, which looked really exhausted. I can't work like this, this is like the greatest distraction ever conceived! My boss told me I was slacking but I couldnt expose my secret, they are so precious to me. Wtf should I do!?  Is anyone in the same situation? How do I get back to productivity? Thank you

64,How waking up at 4:30 AM helps me,"Since the start of 2020, I decided to challenge myself to waking up at 4:30 AM for 1 week after watching an inspiring video fromJocko Willink.

I thought it was kind of crazy to be doing it but I thought I might as well give it a shot.

Little did I know, it was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made which has still stuck with me till this day. 

The biggest benefit to waking up early is that it gives me about **3 hours of undistracted time before work everyday.** At the end of the week, I usually have 10-15 hours of deep work dedicated to myself. (For those of you who haven’t read Deep Work by Cal Newport, I highly recommend it!)

With that extra time every week for the last 1.5 years, I’ve been able to accomplish so much more:

Prior to this, I could never really find the time to read books. 

With the extra hours I have to myself every day, I usually give myself at least 10-30 minutes of that time to reading.

With that said, I usually get about 1-2 chapters in a day. 

I went from reading 0 books to 20-30 books a year. (2~ books a month)

**2) Picked up meditation**

It also allowed me to dedicate a bit of time (10 minutes) to practice mindfulness through meditation.

I’ve found this really helps especially when my day job gets super stressful.

**3) Learned to Code**

The majority of my time was spent teaching myself how to code.

Prior to this, I've always had aspirations to create something that is my own. I knew coding was the way to do it but I was simply too drained at the end of the day to dedicate brain power to it.

With the extra time and fresh mind in the morning, I was able to get through YouTube tutorials and Udemy courses without dozing off or getting bored. 

I went from knowing 0 about computer science to publishing an app on the Google Play Store.

**4) I used to hate Mondays but now I love them**

Getting the Sunday scaries was a real thing for me before.

Now, I never get them because I love waking up knowing I get to work on things that are important to me first.

**It's not for everyone**

I also know waking up early isn't 💯 for everyone but if you feel like it might help you, I hope I can be that push to give it a shot 😁 

I know that if I didn't make the decision to start, I would have never done these things.

What about you guys?? 

I'd love to hear your experiences with waking up early.

Some people were asking how to wake up without hitting the snooze button / etc.

65,How do I stop convincing myself that I need to wait until tomorrow to get a fresh start?,"I know that the title may sound somewhat confusing, but this has happened to me multiple times this month.  Randomly, I will get the urge to be productive and do one of my many tasks, but instead of doing them, I plan and schedule them for *tomorrow*.  I convince myself that in order to do it ""right"", I need to wake up early and just start doing my scheduled tasks.  However, when that alarm goes off the following day, I snooze it and the next thing I know, it's the next day again and I haven't done a single thing.  So, because the day is so scuffed, I convince myself that I should schedule my tasks for tomorrow and... well, I think you get the idea.

How do I stop and break this loop?  And before you say to ""not plan and just do it,"" or ""it's not worth it to plan things out,"" I unfortunately do not have that option since, even though I have a lot of tasks, they are finite and all have deadlines.

66,"Small, 5-minute daily habit that can create a huge uptick in your overall productivity","Hi friends!

This is Brent, I'm a productivity coach, and I was wondering if I could share some ideas with you about small tweaks that you can make to quickly multiply your productivity?

This is one that I don't see mentioned often at all, but I make sure all of my clients do this daily:

**As the last action at the end of the workday, create a list of the 2 or 3 most important things to get done tomorrow. These are the highest priority items that \*must\* get done the following day.**

It's simple but it accomplishes many important things:

1. It makes you discern your highest priorities and focus on them.
2. It makes you clear on what you're actually doing - making you much more likely to do them.
3. It demonstrates to you your progress and helps you create actual momentum that can carry you into higher levels of accomplishment.

If you're struggling with being consistently productive, then try it out for a week! I can guarantee that you'll see a dramatic uptick in your overall productivity.

Let us know how it goes :D

Don't wait until some future moment to do better. You have an opportunity to do better **right now**. Start over. Wipe the slate clean and begin again.

This is easier if you have a way to mark the transition. You could use meal times or other daily rituals to create transitions.

Or you could use physical action as a divider. If you need to get a fresh start for your day, get up and go for a walk, do some breathing exercises, etc. Any of these can help your brain believe that you are leaving behind your previous decisions and making better ones going forward.

70,I spent 6 hours out of bed today!! It got me up and I worked out early in the morning.,"I know it’s not a huge accomplishment but it is to me, I’ve been so lazy just staying in bed most of the time. Instead, I actually got up at around 8:30-9:00am, (Can’t remember when) but I started my workout at 9:50am. I haven’t worked out that early in MONTHS!! I used to do the gym at 9am but currently trying to get a bus pass so lately I’ve been working out more at home. I honestly felt so much better!! I even stretched for 10 minutes! I felt that wasn’t enough for me and I enjoyed it, So I’ll most likely be doing that for 30 minutes every morning for sore muscles. 

I’ll be adding this to my daily routine every morning!! I knew once I started doing YouTube workouts again, I would love it like I used to. I just haven’t had the energy but when I gained 10 lbs in a week, I said enough was enough and need to get more active. I’ve been walking more the past few weeks and not as much as I would like this week, I was sore, but I’d like to go walking more for the rest of this week and have picnics to myself at the park. I aim for 3-4 miles.

5. Have your clothes set out the night before to bypass indecision early in the day. 
6.  Have a weekly meal plan and get all your shopping done for it one day a week. Post meal plan. Plan for leftovers at least two of those days. Yes, it takes time on that one day, but it makes the week so much easier.  My favourite food blog is Once Upon a Chef.

75,Pro Tip: Use a different browser for productivity,"This neat little ""hack"" changed my life. Literally.

Preface: I've had struggles with procrastination for years, but I've been reflecting and improving on that quite a bit recently (also read [my hot post](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/mf0ndg/discussion_stop_reading_and_start_doing_do_you/) on /r/getdisciplined)

I used to use a single browser (Chrome) that was littered with Extensions and Bookmarks (especially a lot in the ""always visible"") toolbar....

Back in 2019, I started a part-time job (web development) where I test websites cross-browser and optimize stuff. (Side note: I spent a big chunk of time making sure things also worked in (old corporate) internet explorer...thankfully they discarded that pile of garbage).

One of the browsers I used most is Firefox (great for web dev if you're into that). I also googled things I didn't know or problems I couldn't solve right in that browser while testing.

Then the semester started again, I had a lot of homework and studying to do and finally gave in to the people screaming about the ""privacy concerns"" with Chrome, deleted it and used FF from there on out.

What was very interesting to see, was I never went to Reddit, or HN, or all the other sites once I started using Firefox. I unconsciously was very productive all of a sudden.

But over time I started adding tons of unread tabs and bookmarks again and eventually signed on to all those unproductive sites in pure avoidance of boredom.

Once I noticed this behavioral pattern through self-reflection it became evident I had to separate my mental space into work and fun. Just like having a bedroom is good for sleeping, having a **separate browser for pure ""procrastination""** felt like a solid solution to me.

So I tried it out for two weeks. Chrome for fun, Firefox for work.

The results were amazing. **Once I opened up FF, my brain just became hard-wired to work.**

Chrome booted up with a plethora of social media tabs reopened from the last session.

I also don't ever have both browsers open at the same time.

&#x200B;

TLDR; Have two separate browsers. One for work, One for fun.

&#x200B;

Try it. Game changer.

76,Working for Agile/SCRUM startup helped me realize why I PROCRASTINATED in the past and how I fixed it.,"I experienced procrastination the most during my university years. It seems high school and university students are still facing this challenge the most. When I browse through reddit, it’s astonishing how severe this problem is for many of them. 

Looking back to my university years, I can understand what was going on and why procrastination was such a big problem for me.  **I** **simply** **had too much time to get my tasks done.** Yeap. You heard it. I had too much time to complete my homework or to prepare for my exams. I had the luxury of time. And **I could afford to spend time on procrastination.** But of course, back then I thought that I was busy. I worked part time since the second year of university. I always had a job on a side. I thought I was busy with school and with work. But in reality, I was not. I gave myself too much time to get things done. 

I realized I only had a problem of procrastination when I was doing homework. Guess what, **I had zero procrastination during the exam time**. You remember what I’m talking about. You walk into this huge auditorium; they sit you down and give you an exam booklet. Then they start the countdown. Sometimes it’s a big clock. Sometimes they write the time on a board. But you see that you only have 2 or 3 hours to get this exam done.

**And never in my life did I see a student who struggled with procrastination during an exam.**

Everyone starts writing the moment they say “go”. These are the exact same students who’ve been suffering from procrastination for the entire semester. Then they walk into this room and wow, their procrastination disease is cured. Why is that? Because they only have 2 hours to get this exam done. And they have no time to waste. 

# Agile/SCRUM Teams

This is also the reason **why Agile and SCRUM became so popular in the tech world**. The team only has a short amount of time (called a sprint) to get major improvements done. In contrast, big corporations loooove long-term planning and long-term projects. They give themselves years to get stuff done. No wonder, they never meet the deadlines.  **When you give yourself too much time, you have time to procrastinate. You have a lot of time to create a lot of drama about your work.** All that overthinking, over-analyzing, over-researching. And the funny thing is even if we give ourselves a lot of time, we end up doing the task at the very end, in a very short period of time. The rest of the time is spent on drama.  I’m sure you’ve heard of **the Parkinson Law.** Work expands to fill the time allotted. If you think you can do a task in a week, you are right. If you think you can do this task in a day, you are also right. 

# The State of Flow

About two years ago, everyone wanted to reach the state of flow. This idea was first proposed in a book called “Flow” by the author with the last name noone can pronounce. Well only the lazy one wasn’t talking about this book in their book reviews videos.  And people tried to find different complicated ways to get to this magic state of flow.  But you know what I’ve found? **It is very easy to be in the state of flow when you give yourself little time to get your tasks done.** It works like crazy! All the inner chatter is gone the moment you realize that you only have an hour to write that blogpost or to prepare that report. Try it for yourself! It’s free! And it’s very effective. 

# You Can Enjoy Your Life

Another amazing thing about giving yourself tight timelines is that you can actually enjoy your life. You have time available for leisure. For fun. For family and friends. And you don’t need to think about all the tasks you should be doing because you got them done in the scheduled time block. Or you know that they are on your schedule and you will get them done tomorrow.

# Time Blocking

I recommend scheduling your tasks in 30-minute increments. Some tasks might take longer. I wouldn’t recommend anything longer than 90 minutes. **Plan for the results, not the activities**. Instead of ""working on the blogpost"", put “publish a blogpost”. 

Reducing the amount of time you give yourself to complete a task **helps with perfectionism**. If you know that you only have an hour to write and publish your blog post, you don’t waste an hour on choosing the perfect cover image. 

I also like that I don’t have to keep thinking about my tasks. I know it’s in my schedule, so **I don’t need to have all the drama in my head** of how i’m not good enough because I haven’t completed these tasks yet. I know that they will get done when it’s time to get them done. Why bother worrying about them now?

# How to Start

If you are new to time blocking and scheduling, I recommend using the concept of **anchoring up**. It means, you need to have an external commitment to get your work done by a specific time. It’s like having a deadline for your assignment back in university days. A professor always gives a specific time you should submit your assignment by. If you are a student, find a buddy.

Let’s say you have a term paper to write. Agree that by Monday noon you will email each other your outlines. By Wednesday noon, you will email each other the literature review section. By Friday noon, you will write your introduction and conclusion. You get the idea. Break the major project down to the tasks that can be done in a few hours and create a deadline for those.

**I recommend having a deadline at 12 pm**. You can get your most important task done in the morning and then enjoy the rest of your day guilt-free. Otherwise, you will spend an entire day anticipating this task and it’s just not fun. 

I’ve used this approach in my grad school. And I was able to finish grad school one semester earlier. And I never did any school work past 4-5 pm. This stuff does work.

Of course, this idea applies to everyone, not just students. Create not only a *date* deadline, create a *time* deadline for your task. *“I will create and submit my quarterly report to my manager by 3 pm on Thursday.”* And don’t give yourself the luxury of time. **Time is only useful when you are resting and recharging. Giving yourself too much time on work or school stuff is never a good idea,** in my experience. It only leads to procrastination, useless perfectionism, drama, and confusion. 

# Conclusion

If you procrastinate doing something, it’s probably because you gave yourself too much time. Or too much ambiguity. Break your tasks down into 30 to 60-minute increments. Put them on your schedule. Plan for the results you will produce in that 30- or 60-minute interval. And be done with these tasks when the time is up. **It doesn’t have to be perfect. It** **just** **needs to** **be done.**

78,How to: Learn way faster,"For whatever reason, there’s a bunch of evidence-based study strategies that drastically increase memory retention, allowing you to be significantly more productive with how you learn things. 

Here is a detailed list of the study strategies that got me through medical school** — one of the toughest courses academically — where I graduated with honours. I think anyone can adopt these principles as they're straightforward yet have such a profound impact on how much you learn. 

When it comes to productivity, it's not just useful in the school context. For anyone else who's a professional that needs to retain knowledge in order to get better at what they do, these techniques can be legitimately game-changing. 

**Firstly, addressing misconceptions:** re-reading, highlighting, and even making complex diagrams is nowhere near as effective as the below techniques. They have their own value, perhaps especially with diagrams where it really can aid understanding, but even then the below stuff has been proven in studies about learning to be more useful. 

## Active Recall

In 2010 there was this scientific study ([https://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6018/772.abstract](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6018/772.abstract)) that basically asked two groups of students to read a passage of text.  The first group wasn’t tested, and the second group was. The second group had retained a massive **50 percent **more of the information a week later than students who had not been tested.

Active recall is the simple process of phrasing your notes as questions, so that instead of having the traditional notes where you literally have pages and pages of big Word/Evernote/Notion documents, you should make it such that **there are a lot of questions and the answers are not revealed immediately.** 

As an example, let’s say you were learning medication doses. This is easiest to do in [Notion](https://youtu.be/pAfN4QM8aRI?t=70) using what’s called Toggle Lists, but if you are using anything else you can **basically start the document with a list of questions** and test yourself on those. 

1. “What is the dose of paracetamol?” 
2. “What is the dose of panadol osteo?” 
3. “How much paracetamol would be considered overdose?” 

And with this list of questions at the top, instead of just mindlessly re-reading through your note to study/revise, use these questions and do your best to answer them. It’s actually not a bad thing if you get them wrong, because by getting them wrong, you’ll prime the brain to accept the actual answer — and it will stick in your brain much better. 

You can literally use this for any field of study and any subject:
1. “How would you write a for-loop in Python?” 
2. “Describe the process of photosynthesis?” 
3. “What would the gravitational force of a drop bear be if it weighed 1kg and dropped 100 metres, not accounting for air resistance?” 

## Spaced repetition
Active Recall will take you some of the way there, and improve short to medium term retention massively, so it’s the best place to start. However, the next thing you should do is to make sure to use a _spaced repetition_ software.

Basically I use Anki. What this software does is that it shows you a flashcard with a question, and then when you press Enter it will come up with the answer. You then choose whether you need to see that question again, or if you found it good or easy in which case it won’t show you the question again immediately. 

When you select easy, it means that it’s pretty solidly in your memory, so it’s worthwhile revising at a later time - like 5 days, for example. But if you found things hard, you should probably revise within a shorter timeframe. 

Anki lets you work on the act of memorising things really quickly **and is the single best thing you can do for your long term memory**. By showing you things you don’t know a lot in short spaces of time, and showing you things you have a reasonably good memory of over longer stretches of time, it transforms short term memories into long term ones. I honestly still remember diagrams that I drew 6 years ago of the brain that I never re-revised after the year that I learnt it, not because I use it in everyday life (how often is it that you need to think of the location of Broca’s area?) but purely thanks to spaced repetition. 

## An anti-procrastination system

Now that you’ve got the ideal methods for masterful retention of knowledge - which are already good enough to propel your grades much higher than if you don’t use these methods - it’s time to wrap up the techniques with the macroscopic view of using a system to make sure to actually study consistently. 

It’s fun to have the thought that “I do better when I’m cramming”, but the counter argument would be that you can still cram despite studying consistently and that would guarantee a better mark than just cramming. Unfortunately, cramming also keeps things in fairly short term memory, so when you come across actually tricky scenarios it’s much harder to use that information for novel situations. 

In my medical school years, a simple thing I used was a diary with defined times on them for studying, and the app Forest as a pomodoro timer (where you do 25 minutes of study and then take 5 minutes of break and repeat). Waayyy more recently though I’ve been a total fan of the [Animedoro](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dabido+animedoro&sp=QgIIAQ%253D%253D), because that’s been super hype/motivating and I genuinely wish I did this during my earlier years of school, as it would have made an otherwise fairly exhaustive process way more fun. 

If you’re sociable in nature, another way you can hack yourself into doing more work is simply to do things in groups with other motivated people. Key word being motivated, because being overly distracted is obviously going to drag everyone down - however, the fun factor _usually_ dominates any loss in retention. Having to meet up with people also necessitates a “promise” to do work, and not a flimsy promise to yourself which can be easily broken, but a promise with the consequence of disappointing your friends. 

## Conclusion
I hope this has been helpful for you and I promise if you implement these techniques properly, they will make a big difference to how well you do.",l9d13h,697,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/l9d13h/how_to_learn_way_faster/
79,S.T.O.P. - Don't Screw The Evening Up,"So, the alarm clock rings.

You feel like you've been hit by a train, so you snooze that 5-6 times.

Eventually you wake up, later than you wanted, in zombie mode, and you feel like s\*it.

Sounds familiar?

The number one reason why I f\*ck up my own productivity is SCREWING UP THE EVENING.

Evening is tricky.

Time passes by and you don't really realize how unproductive you've been.

It's not like during the morning: around lunch time, you get a reality check.  
If you did nothing, you know it (and feel bad about it).

But when you start watching YT videos around 8PM and you find yourself still there around midnight, it feels different.  
It can be Netflix, videogame, *""whatever turns your crank, man""* (<-quote)

It makes sense from one point of view, because it's relaxing time. You want to chill after a day of action faking, while you haven't really been productive, but you're exhausted though, so you deserve your 4 hours of whatever.

Don't f\*ck up your evening.

They are the reason why you can't wake up early.  
They are the reason why you're gonna feel s\*it all they long.

I use to be productive at times, waking up around 6AM and find myself DOING things.  
By 10AM i'd already done so many things, feeling proud, productive and satisfied.

One single night was enough.  
Went to bed late and the magic was gone.  
Unproductive again!  


Don't f\*ck up your evening.  
Be extremely tough and disciplined. Establish an evening routine.

Choose what time you want to be in bed (based on the time you want to wake up).  
1 hour before, switch off all the devices. Laptop, smartphone.

Take care of your body, brush your teeth and whatever you use to do.

I'm not here to impose a routine on anyone, I'm sure you can find what it works for you.

Personally, planning the next day brings a bit of peace of mind.  
Open Google Calendar and time block the next day.

Some people likes journaling, at night I don't really have the energy to write too much, but laying down on the bed and think about the day in order is quicker and has the same effect.

Doing a bit of meditation too.   
I tried guided ones, but having the headphones was actually keeping me awake.

Reading a light book or listening to an audiobook can help as well.

Drinking hot stuff, taking melatonin.

Choose your routine and stick with it.

**Final Words**

No, no links to my blog cause i don't have a blog.  
No, no links to my yt channel cause i don't have a yt channel.

Everyone is different, i don't believe in imposing routine and lists full of generalized tips.

  
Diagnose yourself, find what's the real problem for you.   
For me is the evening, so i guess for other it might be that as well.  


Also, I don't believe in the **wake up early secret power.**  
It's not about what time you do wake up, it's about the amount of hours you put into the actual work.

Some people can do just fine waking up at 12pm.  
If you're a night owl, follow your cycles and whatever makes you feel productive.

Personally, I tend to be a night owl, but my productivity is in the morning.

82,My most important insights after a year of productivity.,"Hey friends, my year has been almost completely focused on productivity, and I wanted to share what I've learned. In particular, I read three books at the beginning of the year, leading to changes in how I  work, which significantly increased my output. I'll include a link at the bottom to my yearly review where I go deeper into my progress and results for the year. 


**[Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits) / The Importance of Consistency:**


Before you worry about anything else, make sure you are consistent. Being super productive 16 hours every blue moon doesn't matter if its not something you can rely on. Whatever your productivity is focused on, build a routine around it. This ensures steady progress towards your goal, which quickly adds up. More importantly, it also becomes something you can learn to optimize in terms of planning and getting the most out of each hour spent.

An important takeaway from Atomic Habits when it comes to achieving consistency is that you should not expect it to be something you can just will yourself to happen by trying hard or wanting it. You have to be proactive about building your life in such a way that you get pushed into being consistent, even on days where you are not feeling motivated. 


**[Deep Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work) / The Importance of Focus:**


Whenever I highlight this point, it feels like a truism. Of course you want to focus. Even so, after over a decade of dabbling in productivity and knowledge work, completely internalizing how important focus is was a big mindset shift for me. Staying focused is harder to do than ever before, but training your focus is also more powerful than it has ever been. This means: to the victor go the spoils. Having control over your focus is becoming both rarer and more valuable as time passes. Take this area of your productivity very seriously. Some key factors:

* **View focusing as a skill and be deliberate about it.**

You want to view focus as a skill you can learn or a muscle you can train. Don't just think ""I should try to focus more"" without making any changes to your day. Carve out chunks of your day with a pre-defined interval where you set yourself up for focused work. It makes sense to start small (10-25 minutes, then a break). From there, build yourself up slowly. Being able to focus for 60-90 minutes without getting distracted is a good target to aim for.

* **No outside distractions.**

When you sit down to focus, ensure that no notifications can reach you. Your phone should not vibrate or light up under any circumstances. If you have a habit of picking up your phone when you work, put it outside of the room. Similarly, close anything on the computer which sends notifications or reminders. If you are working on a computer and have problems with procrastination or instinctively open distracting websites/email I also strongly recommend you use a site blocker like Cold Turkey for these focused sessions.

* **Context switching is poison.**

I've heard Cal Newport say that jumping between tasks is like chugging a bottle of Whiskey before going to lift weights and I don't think he is far off. It is tough to fully appreciate the cost of context switching or multi-tasking. This is especially true because jumping between different emails and tasks makes you feel busy, which in turn makes you feel productive. Don't trust your feelings on how productive you have been. Look at the actual output at the end of the day and you will likely find that both quality and quantity is much lower than it is if you give 100% of your focus to a single task until it is done. In your focus sessions, you focus on one thing until that task is done. No excuses, no rationalizations.


**[Peak Performance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31450959-peak-performance) / The Importance of Rest:**


I'm sure I won't be alone here: This was a hard pill to swallow, but also the most impactful. I don't frequent subreddits like /r/productivity because I want to take it easier. I want to optimize my life and work towards my goals. But last year even with an incredible amount of drive, at the end of the year I fell short of where I needed to be to have any chance of accomplishing my goals. I realized something had to change, and I read Peak Performance at just the right time.

In most normal jobs the important thing is staying 8+ hours at work. Your output is secondary, if it even matters at all. This instills the mindset that what matters with your own productivity is the hours you put in, which is very far from the truth. You are not trying to spend as much time as possible. You are trying to maximize high-quality output. I'm sure most will recognize how big of a difference it is when you are at your best compared to an average day. Taking rest seriously is about bringing your average closer to your best, making your best happen more often, and completely avoiding your worst. 

If you are not currently deliberate about your rest: Don't fall into the same trap I did of thinking you are an exception who can power through and performs as well without regular rest. This is not only about avoiding burnout or overworking. Regardless of how you are performing currently, assume that you will perform even better and more consistently by taking this area seriously. 

The changes I made after reading Peak Performance is that I now take a 5-10 minute break between every 50 minutes of Focus (I use [Focusmate](https://www.focusmate.com/), which keeps me to that schedule). An important aspect of these breaks is that I avoid all stimulation. Definitely don't check email, messages, social media, or Reddit, but also don't listen to music, podcasts read, or do anything else that keeps your mind occupied. Go for a walk, do some stretching, or maybe do a simple chore. Just do something monotonous and simple while you give your mind some time to digest.


While I was not a slouch before,  I still saw more improvements than I had any right to hope for this year. Primarily thanks to a deeper appreciation for the things mentioned. In terms of consistency, every so often I used to fall off the wagon. This year most breaks are something I've deliberately planned out in advance. In terms of what I'm able to produce for each hour spent, it feels like the output has increased in the ballpark of 2x. As mentioned, I've recently had my yearly review where I go into my results and progress this year, giving a better idea for what these ideas look like when actioned on, hopefully inspiring some of you to do just that: [**Yearly Review with art progress.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaytowiD2gg&t)",kt8xbu,671,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/kt8xbu/my_most_important_insights_after_a_year_of/
83,Unconventional Productivity Tips found on Reddit [March 2021],"I collected my favourite productivity tips I have discovered last month on reddit.

You can find the February collection [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/lwoxfx/unconventional_productivity_tips_found_on_reddit/).

# Tip #1: The price of creativity is the judgment of others.

[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/m88qa2/discussion_the_price_of_creativity_is_the/) to the original reddit post.

I found the title of that post so true. Just one sentence, yet so much meaning.

I always thought that the price of creativity is overcoming resistance. But now I would add this component as well.

**Creative process = Overcoming resistance + Willingness to face the judgement of others.** 

# Tip #2: It is normal to be lazy sometimes.

[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/mefzbm/advice_how_a_very_simple_shift_in_thinking/) to the original reddit post.

The post’s main idea is about committing to 2 minutes of whatever habit you want to develop. However, what caught my attention was something mentioned at the very beginning:

>*“Humans are innately wired to take the path of least resistance, and it seems most things in the universe have this bias.If we look from an evolutionary context, our bias to be lazy has good intentions.Primal man did not have UberEATS or Dominos Pizza delivery on standby – Every day was a bitter struggle for survival.A human who expanded their energy doing unproductive things like dancing in a tree for several hours or digging random holes was more likely to get eaten by a sabre-tooth tiger.Meanwhile, his ‘lazy’ friends had the energy to run away.The problem is our primal programming still persists.”*

I feel like we’ve categorized unproductive behaviour as something shameful. We are being bombarded with the message of never-ending hustle. I like that the author reminds us that it is biologically normal to preserve energy. It is *not* normal to want to do things *all* the time. It is not human to be productive all the time.

# Tip #3: Focused on 3 tasks a day for a year. Depression is gone.

[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/m8ne82/one_year_after_doing_only_3_tasks_a_day_heres_an/) to the original reddit post.

The author only had three slots on the to-do list to fill out each day. By having such a limited number of to-do tasks, he was forced to prioritize the things that truly matter. He committed to the selected few. **Less but better**. Plus, the smaller tasks didn’t feel like a chore anymore because they were not on his to-do list. He didn’t *have to* do them. I highly recommend reading the entire post where he lists all the achievements he had as a result of doing 3 tasks a day for one year.

I couldn’t agree more with the benefits that come from prioritizing your tasks. I keep saying that very few things are truly urgent and important. That’s why I only focus on a limited number of goals each month. If forces me to prioritize all the tasks/goals and see what is truly important. It brings an incredible level of intentionality and focus. It propels you forward because you end up doing the most impactful tasks that you could be doing that day instead of filling your time with low-value activities.

# Tip #4: Set a timer.

[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/lwnvzj/method_timers_have_changed_my_life_and_helped/) to the original reddit post.

An author who got diagnosed with ADHD turned his/her life around by setting timers for different activities throughout the day.

It is Sunday and I don’t do time blocking on the weekends. However, I know that I need to write this post. I thought let me try this timer advice.

Right now I have a timer running as I am writing this post. There is one thing for sure. Having a timer makes *starting* an activity a lot less painful. You just start. You don’t browse social media, play the perfectionism game or fool yourself into believing that you need to do just a little more research.

**A timer might be that miraculous cure against procrastination you’ve been searching for.** 

# Tip #5: Newton’s First Law.

[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/m1eoye/if_i_had_only_1_piece_of_productivity_advice_to/) to the original reddit post.

>*“Newton’s first law states that an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion at the same velocity unless acted on by an unbalanced force.Using this law in productivity, if you stay in sloth mode, you’ll remain in sloth mode.If you decide to jumpstart yourself and get started on something, you’ll get the ball rolling.”*

The mention of Newton’s First Law in this article made me realize something. Every time I listen to the interviews of people who completely transformed their lives, these people get asked on how they started. The answers you hear are often a bit blah… to say the least. Something very mandane. Even boring. The activities that they mention are so small that you don’t even believe these people when they say it. Because you see the “before” and “after” pictures, numbers, titles, etc. And there is no way “walking around the block after dinner” could’ve created the result you see on those “before” and “after” pictures.

I now realize that this gap between the initial tiny action and the final result can be explained by the Newton’s First Law. When you commit to the tiny action, you change your state from “an object staying at rest” to “an object being in motion”. And once you are in motion, you tend to stay in motion. And a tiny action then grows to an action that is 5% bigger. Then it’s another 5%. And in a few months being “in motion” in one area of your life, other areas of your life go from being “at rest” to being “in motion”. It is a chain reaction that eventually results in major changes. But it all started from a tiny action that moved us from being “at rest” to “being in motion”.

87,I either do nothing all day or I work from morning to evening without breaks until I get sick of it,"You might say it’s fine that I also have days when I work non stop, but I think it’s actually a disadvantage. 

I can take yesterday as example, when I studied for 7 hours (it’s a lot for me, because I still try to get accustomed to longer periods of focus). The longest break was around 10 minutes when I had to prepare my dinner, but that was all. It was great to accomplish many tasks that day, but I felt mentally exhausted and tired. 

Today I have absolutely no motivation to do anything, as if I have a specific amount of energy for being productive and I’ve already completely finished it for the next days. That’s where the disadvantage stands, I don’t want to work to the point of mental exhaustion and then take 2-3 days as a break when I would feel guilty. 

It seems that I can only work like that. I don’t know how to strike a balance and I admire those people who’re able to say “I’ll efficiently work for 4 hours today and then I’ll relax”. I know so many people who’re actually able to finish all their goals in a relatively short period of time (some of them have a lot of activities during the day) and still have free time so that they won’t get bored or tired.

91,How I went from extreme Night Owl to waking up at 5 am every day,"Hey friends. I wanted to share this because I used to think having a solid sleep schedule was completely beyond me. I'm sure there are others in a similar position I was in, thinking they can't get sleeping under control. For some people that is true, I'm not saying sleep disorders don't exist. But for some, the issue is not that it's impossible, just that they haven't put in consistent effort over a long enough timeframe.

## My sleep journey

For the first 30 years of my life, my sleep was a complete mess. I would often stay up until 3-7 am, even when I had work in the morning. And I'd also sometimes go to work without sleeping (in an attempt to turn around my sleep schedule). I would have a couple of rationalisations for why good sleep was out of reach:


- If I was sleep-deprived and tired at the start of the day, I would tell myself ""I should"" be able to fall asleep at night. Then I'd spend hours trying to fall asleep and tell myself this was evidence that I couldn't get a consistent sleep schedule.
- It felt like my sleep did not align with 24 hours, and I'd get tired/fall asleep later each night.
- I was never bothered by being sleep deprived, so I saw it as a trade-off: I can't consistently sleep well, but on the flipside, I function better than others on little sleep.


Now I wake up at 5-6 am every day without an alarm. I go to bed at the same time every day and always fall asleep within a few minutes. I also find that when I stick to my schedule for a longer period I progressively wake up earlier until I settle on 6-7 hours each night. Falling asleep in minutes is by far the most significant benefit for me because lying in bed trying to sleep is the most boring and frustrating thing ever, and it used to happen to me regularly, sometimes for 4+ hours.

## What Changed

I realized the only way I can make consistent progress on a game I'm making is to do it in the mornings before work, and to do that I had to get sleeping under control. There are a lot of small tweaks and tips. I more into detail about specific tips in a video I made: [**How I fall Asleep in Minutes, An Ex-Night Owls Guide**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v-SSSBt9Vc), but to highlight what I think is the two most important things:

### Consistency

More than anything you need to be consistent. Both consistent in the short term, e.g. going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, but also to be consistent over a longer period to see if this works for you. I'd recommend putting aside at least one month where sleep is the #1 priority, where you don't have late weekend nights and get up every single day at a specific time without any exceptions.


As you start to fall asleep easier, it also becomes a lot easier to stay consistent. I was inconsistent with bed times in the past because I wanted to make sure I was tired enough to fall asleep easily. But now it's easy to go to bed because I know I'm not rolling the dice with X hours of boredom before I fall asleep.

### Light

Light has a big influence on our circadian rhythm, both in the morning and in the evening. You want to dim the lights in the evening, and you want to wear blue light blocking glasses. I know you can reduce blue light on screens at night, but my understanding is this is not nearly as effective as putting on glasses that make everything orange and blocks out 99% of blue light. I always wear these the last 2 hours before bed.


In the morning, you want to make sure you get a lot of bright light, and a good habit of getting into is to go out for a walk and get some sunlight as soon as you wake up.


Going into every little tip for sleep would make this post way too long. But the important message of this post is not the specific tips. I just wanted to share how I was certain that a consistent sleep schedule was impossible for me for the first 30 years of my life, but after making it the #1 priority for 1-2 months, I realized I just hadn't tried hard enough for long enough. So I make anyone struggling with sleep who has not made it a #1 priority for at least a month to do just that.",m71qwe,640,72,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/m71qwe/how_i_went_from_extreme_night_owl_to_waking_up_at/
92,I figured out why I'm so tired and struggling with managing my time,"It comes from the head.

So, why do I so often find myself just out of it, like my brain is full of cotton candy and trying to collect my thoughts is like trying to herd cats? Hours can go by while I'm doing some repetitive nonsense. I tried every procrastination trick I've ever heard about, without success. From people's description, the anatomy of my ""procrastination"" was somewhat different than what they seem to be describing and it was driving me mad.

Then yesterday I heard my neighbors arguing again. I've just finished meditation and I was very attuned to myself - and I saw myself emotionally freeze. Cotton candy in my head, thoughts like a swarm of bees. I have suffered prolonged trauma as a child and learned to freeze up since I had no way of escaping or ending the situation. In therapy, I've discovered I do this a lot in social situations to stop myself even thinking about disagreeing with someone before I get the chance. I stop my brain.

I emotionally check out whenever there's a situation that my brain learned is dangerous for me when I was a kid. It's not just people being angry, but also any kind of uncertainty. So I just lose hours in this switched off state to stop myself from doing something that would put me in danger. A kind of perfectionism comes into play as well. Only perfect is safe. 

As we were talking about it with my partner, I accidentally turned off the music we've been listening to. I quickly put it back in place, but he noticed how panicked I got when that happened. I never really noticed. It's... normal. As I went about my day, I kept noticing so many little jolts of panic from the tiniest of (mis)perceived mistakes, tens, hundreds of them, little moments of terror that someone's about to pounce at me for this... Totally normal in my life, not worth note until now - how can one NOT get absolutely exhausted, frazzled, riled up if these just keep coming? I'm here wondering how I even get anything done at all...

I'm so happy I understand this now. This is workable. I'm not broken or wrong or bad for not being able to get stuff done, it makes sense. I've dealt with many of the same issues in different contexts already and I know it can be done. Therapy is really helpful. I think I've just made a kind of breakthrough.

93,Procrastination explained by neuroscience,"I think this subreddit contains enough helpful solutions for the many procrastinating posts I’m seeing lately. I want to try to explain **why** we’re prone to procrastinate. 

We tend to choose the easiest activities over the most rewarding. We have two faulty beliefs: life should be easy and our self-worth is dependent on our success. Procrastinating allows us to delay putting our reputations on the line until later. This is an ego-protective maneuver.

This has a neural foundation: our limbic system (supporting behavior, emotion) seeks immediate rewards and comes into conflict with our prefrontal cortex (supporting executive functions like planning, decision making, problem-solving, self-control) which understands the consequences of falling behind. Both regions run on dopamine but have different actions in each.

Dopamine in the prefrontal cortex causes us to stay on task and focus while dopamine in the limbic system causes us to feel pleasure. We put things off whenever the desire for immediate pleasure (social media, unnecessary or unproductive work) wins out over our ability to delay gratification. 

If our self-confidence *and* the value of the task are high, we’re less likely to procrastinate. This is pitted against two factors: how soon will the reward come and how distractable we are. Which means, if the length of time it will take to complete the task is high **or** our distractibility is high, this will lead to an increase in procrastination.",lpuwi7,630,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/lpuwi7/procrastination_explained_by_neuroscience/
94,+ 21 Tips for Building a Better You in 2021 +,"**Hi dear friends! I wish you all a happy new year!** 🎁🎄🎉🎊

I hope you're all doing well and going strong in every aspect of your lives! and if Not, It's Ok I'm here with you and we'll try to fix that!

This is the first time that I'm gonna write anything here, so this will probably be a long article and not a flawless one since English isn't my first language but I hope you find it helpful!

First I'm gonna talk a little about myself and my journey. I'm 24 years old and got my bachelor's degree in computer science last year and currently studying for the national university entrance exam for master's degree for the second year in a row because I didn't get the results that I wanted last year. I was never a hardworking kind of student, I was always told that I'm smart by my parents but they've never told me about the importance of hard work so that led me to the delusion of :

"" It's Ok you're Smart so you don't have to world hard as others! ""

I grew up in a religious and stressful family where my dad was the type of a bad tempered and self-righteous person who always had a lot of reasons to get angry and my mother was the loving and caring one who was always trying to protect me. Don't get me wrong they both love me equally it's just that my father didn't know how his behaviors could've affected me in a destructive way which it certainly did!

To be honest I'm not blaming them because that's just the way most parents were and were taught that way , that means I've had to learn these lessons the hard way and by myself like many of you!

I've learned a lot during these trials and errors and I've developed a Lot, I'm sure these tips can be helpful to some of you and can be used in your Life in order to build a better version of yourself!

So here we go :

&#x200B;

**1. Be Grateful**

You cannot be completely happy in your life if you're not already aware of what you already have! Why? because you're always chasing something you don't have and even after getting it, it's the same damn cycle over and over again!

"" I'll be happy when I get rich! ""

"" I'll be happy when I cracked that exam or got that grade! ""

"" I'll be happy if only he/she behave me better ""

"" I'll be happy if my parents be that way ""

People Please! Stop bullshi\*ting yourself!

Life is a journey, Not a Destination! so learn to enjoy all of it.

Make a list of everything that you've been blessed with in your life and look at it every morning. You have to always appreciate what you have **While you still have it!** Don't take everything for granted, celebrate every breath, Be thankful!

&#x200B;

**2. Your Past Doesn't Define Who You Are**

We all have our regrets and fuck ups in life, Nobody's Perfect! But just for a minute sit and think about how exactly can you change that if you keep thinking about it for countless hours, days, months or even for years for someone like me! It's Past, It's Gone!

Do you really want to sit again in a month, a year or even 10 years and regret about the days you're wasting now? Don't let your mind be wandering all the time about could haves and should haves of your life!

&#x200B;

**3. You Cannot Control Everything**

One of the things that led to my failure in last year's exam was the fact that **I wanted to be Sure** about the outcome and tried to control it like I did with many other things before that. But it doesn't work that way and it doesn't need to be. Thinking about the things you cannot control will only lead you to become more stressful and anxious over the time and it'll really affects your productivity!

Whenever that you find yourself thinking too much about something that it's out of your control simply let go of that and **see what can you control** in that area and start working on it!

&#x200B;

**4. Love Yourself For Who You Are**

As I've mentioned before, Nobody's perfect! So why even bother seek perfection? We all have our flaws as well as our beauties. If you're not satisfied with yourself how do you expect others to love you? Nothing is more destructive than a Bad self image. Learn to acknowledge your beauties, and let go of the things that you cannot change in yourself. Believe me no one will ever critic you as bad as yourself!

&#x200B;

**5. Surround Yourself With Positive & Successful People**

Remember that **others people don't define you!** But it's very important whom do you hang around with! as the saying that goes **"" Show me your friends and I'll show you your future ""**

hanging with these kind of people will lift your sight and standards drastically, on the other hand you should stay away from negative and small minded people! Being around them will simply discourage you. If you can't get away from them (they're family), encourage them to change their perspective of life but don't waste too much time and energy for a person who doesn't believe or don't want to change.

&#x200B;

**6. You Don't Know Everything And That's Ok**

The delusion of being a mastermind in everything only leads you to failure and misery. Being aware of the fact that you don't know everything motivates you to keep learning and seeking help from others (not every person!) to help you grow and see your problem through other perspectives.

Remember that you are not Always Right!

&#x200B;

**7. Develop The Right Mindset**

Mindset is everything! Doesn't matter how much you've tried or accomplished, If you don't have the right Mindset you'll be back to square one as soon as the first setback or relapse hits you in the face! Always look at how far you've come instead of how much you have to go, Practice positivity in every situation, turn your weaknesses to your strengths. everybody has setbacks and relapses but the winners are those who know how to learn and recover from it not to sit and cry for themselves!

Some people may misunderstand being positive with being unrealistic but remember everything will appear "" Unrealistic "" to a limited mindset!

&#x200B;

**8. Better Habits Leads To Better You**

Motivation is what gets you started but Habit is what keeps you going!

Most of us know what is good for us and what should be our habits but it ain't worth sh\*t unless you actually make a plan to make you life better and act on it. But don't overwhelm yourself with a lot of work to do at once! Work on one thing to improve at a time. You can progress faster as you go forward and become more disciplined and organized.

\- Fixing your sleeping schedule.

\- Meditating everyday in fresh air, Reading more self-improvement books rather than binge-watching hours & hours of Netflix or YouTube.

\- Exercise daily for at least 30 minutes at any cost! (Super Important!)

\- Eat only about 80% percent of your stomach, Drink more water, Avoid junk food

\- Limit social media as much as possible (You'll be alright after a few days trust me it's worth it!)

\- Start your day with a small task done such as making your bed.

\- Never ever start your day unplanned even if you don't have many specific tasks for the day. Use a notebook or a task management app to write everything that you wanna do that day.

There are so many more worth to be mentioned, make a list of what habits you want to develop and bring them into action one by one!

&#x200B;

**9. Forgive Yourself For The Mistakes You've Made And Move On**

Our mind & body has a limited amount of energy per day. Thinking about your mistakes constantly doesn't change the fact that you've made them but it'll certainly consumes a huge amount of your daily energy and then what'll happen? You'll do nothing that day and find yourself saying to yourself at the night :

"" ah sh\*t ! here we go again ! I might as well procrastinate and start tomorrow ! ""

Remember, there is no such thing as failure and mistake as long as you **Keep Learning** from them and trying not to repeat them again!

&#x200B;

**10. You're 100% Responsible For You Life**

I guess many of us get used to keep looking for something or someone to blame whenever sh\*t doesn't go well in our life, right?

As long as you have not fully accepted that you're the only sailor of you ship, Nothing will change in your life and if something does you wouldn't even notice it!

Be completely honest with yourself and think about every failure and relapse that happened to you, were you in charge of doing it or did anyone tied you in front of your screen while threatening you with a gun, making you to watch porn and masturbate? yep that's what I've thought!

I can guarantee you can find something you could've done better in everything that you failed at!

And even if there's some external forces and other things involved you still have a full control over making your choices based on the situation, So don't lie to yourself!

&#x200B;

**11. It's Not Always About You**

You should be realizing that every person that you meet is fighting a battle that you know nothing about! So don't be so quick to make everything about yourself, Don't judge people easily!

Learn to Listen better and you'll understand better.

&#x200B;

**12. Be Humble**

Life has many ups and downs so Never ever ever look down on anybody because you don't know how bad you may fall yourself one day!

Be kind, Forgive others, help them without expecting anything in return!

I Promise It will return to you!

&#x200B;

**13. Focus On Today**

To be honest I rather say only focus on your next hour!

You should have plans for your future and no one is denying that but focusing on anything more than your following day and hours has a great chance of stressing you out and making you more nervous!

Take one step at a time, make a list of what you wanna do for the day, finish the ones which can be done in less than 2-5 minutes first and then take care of the rest with a more clear mind!

&#x200B;

**14. Create The Right Environment**

Don't expect yourself to be fully functional when you're sitting in a chaotic room!

Better Lighting, Air conditioning, organized desk and etc. will all majorly help you to focus & work better for longer periods of time!

&#x200B;

**15. Get Comfortable With Being Uncomfortable**

It's funny how we don't give a pass to others easily whenever they do against our desire, but we keep giving ourselves passes without hesitation!

"" I've procrastinated today so I'll keep doin' it and start from tomorrow! ""What happens after? ---> \*procrastinates for a week straight\*

"" It's October 28th, I will relapse everyday until November starts! ""What happens after? ---> \*relapses on November 3rd\*

"" It's 9:34 AM I'll study at 10:00 because I'll get cancer if I start right now it has to be at 10 sharp! ""What happens after? ---> \*gets laziness cancer\*

"" I'm really overweight and I have to start exercising but let's just finish this pizza right now! ""What happens after? ---> \*whines about getting rejected by every girl in a 2000mile radius\*

Do you wanna see massive changes in your life? then Say goodbye to your comfort zone, NOW!

Life means nothing if you don't take Risks!

&#x200B;

**16. Set Goals That Move You Everyday (Even Scare You!)**

Having high aspirations and big dreams is a must for life, You may have heard about S.M.A.R.T. Goals = Specific , Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-Bound

These are some good rules to follow in my opinion.

You should exactly clarify what you want otherwise it'll remain just an idea in your mind and you'll have no idea how to break it down into smaller doable chunks. Don't tell yourself earning a million dollars in not achievable and realistic so I cannot put that at my list!

If anybody has done it before then it falls into S.M.A.R.T. category.

So don't make lazy ass excuses!

Also don't forget to Visualize yourself when you've achieved them! If you can visualize yourself achieving it, that means it's meant to happen and just needs your effort! and if you can't visualize, it means you still don't know what you're capable of!

&#x200B;

**17. Be Hungry - Hard Working - Patient**

Just having a goal doesn't mean that you'll achieve it no matter what! regardless of how big it is,

It's all about how bad do you want it, how hungry you are, how many hours are you willing to put into that to make it happen and **most importantly** how patient you are! Because if you lack any of those you'll not last the first 2-3 failures & setbacks!

&#x200B;

**18. Lower Your Expectations of Yourself**

This may seem completely opposite of the last two tips but hear me out first, you should understand that you're not a robot or machine, You're a Human! You'll get tired, you'll get discouraged, you'll burn out, you'll lose faith, you'll get to a point when you just wanna Quit.....

**But!** you have to realize that you're trying your best and know when to quit and take a break!

Knowing that under what conditions or rules you function best is essential in order to not feel guilty when you need to take a break. Enjoy it and then get back to work stronger!

&#x200B;

**19. Talk To Yourself Everyday**

Many people are naturally confident or have a sense of self worth either because of how they raised or what they've accomplished! But what if you're someone who doesn't have either of those?

In that case you'll train yourself, you'll help yourself and you'll talk to Yourself for every goddamn day until you believe it!

Make a list and read it for yourself every day, write things such as I'm smart, I'm this, I'm that but only things that'll boost your f\*cked up self-esteem!

And you don't have to be realistic! because your reality certainly hasn't paid off for you!

&#x200B;

**20. Life Is Not Fair**

One of the things that saved me of lot of overthinking and bullshi\*ting myself was realizing the fact that Life isn't fair and it will never be! You'll fail more often, but knowing that nothing has to change in universe in order for you to be more successful is necessary. You don't need luck, Try harder, plan smarter, Be aware of your mistakes and identify the cues and triggers and luck will keep coming to you, It's Simple as That!

&#x200B;

**21. You Always Have A Choice**

I'm sure that a lot of my tips are complement to each other and that's totally normal.

2020 is gone and all the years before that, But from this moment on you have to choose how you want to spend your seconds, hours, days, months and years! and you always, always have a choice!

Whether it's denying an urge to procrastinate for one more hour or making a career changing decision, both will still have an effect on your life. So don't overthink about what could go wrong, a little stress may be good for you to keep you from being totally careless but don't let that sabotage your mind guys!

Make your days count instead of counting them, The best is yet to come Believe me!

My exam is on May 28th (About 146 days), I'll promise myself and you guys that I'll not make the wrong choices this time!

\*Edit : Thanks for your kind comments, I feel there's something else that needs to be more highlighted here :

My dear friends, Knowing about all these tips and reading self improvement books and more, is great but none of them would even make any difference if you don't **Act** on them!  

A person who acts but doesn't know much about these kinda tips & hacks is miles ahead of someone who has all these knowledge and doesn't apply it make his/her life even slightly better, because the one who acts will eventually learn more and more!

95,how do i do stuff with ✨depression✨,"i really don't want to hear ""put your phone down now and go do something!!!"" or like ""you're doing this for you!!"" or about productivity systems or whatever. it doesn't help.

my problem is that i don't have the mental energy do do more than a few productive  things a day, mostly doing the dishes and walking my dog. sometimes i can't even get into the shower. dirty laundry piles up until i have no clean clothes and i am not maintaining my aquariums enough.

i have set alarms but they don't help the fact that i don't have the energy to get up and do the things.

honestly i think summer vacation from college has made my mental health a little worse because now there's no sense of accomplishment. lately i mostly play video games while feeling sad.

any advice would be appreciated.",o6lv2f,630,134,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/o6lv2f/how_do_i_do_stuff_with_depression/
96,Beware the person who tells you how much they’re working.,"They might be trying to scare you.

I often notice that the most successful people have learned how to work \*efficiently\*. Most of the time, people who talk about how much they're working are insecure about their place in the world and they may be trying to justify their own existence by telling you how difficult their life is.

97,My method for being in the office at 6:30AM as an entrepreneur,"Sometimes it's hard to be on time knowing that nothing happens in the short term if you're not, so every day before I leave the office I leave this shredder with a banknote scheduled for shredding at 6:30 the next day if I don't pick it up on time

98,"I just had a startling realization, I procrastinate because I can't tolerate the 'control' my work/routine/tasks have on me.","I just read somewhere procrastination is a 'symptom' of some deeper underlying issue.So I dived in and analyzed my mental state myself to get what was it after all that was leading me to procrastination.

A few weeks prior, I had discovered promodoro technique, discovered a few other productivity methods. I employed them and was going pretty well.I was able to consistently give 10 hours a day to deep focused productive work,Then I collapsed. All of sudden. And I have been like this, procrastinating for the last 4 days.

That really got me thinking. After all the first step towards betterment is to identify the cause.

The book I was reading said the underlying cause for procrastination for some was fear of failure, for some, it's perfectionism and for some, it's an avoidance technique to cope with anxiety.

But that didn't resonate 100& me. Sure I procrastinated as avoidance but that wasn't because of fear of failure.I just realized I hate the general feeling of having a predecided schedule that dictates my time. I hate it having power over me. It fills me with this feeling as if some invisible chains have locked me. That's the feeling I tend to cope with avoidance. That's what I fight against and I procrastinate to break my routine and take back the control.

Even if the routine is self-imposed, I felt entrapped as if some exterior force has put me in a cage. It's ridiculous now that I've realized it. But that's what I feel.

Now that I'm really exploring my feelings, even the idea of holding into an unchanging, predecided task EVERY single day horrifies me. Is it the same for you guys?

I don't know, it just sounds so appallingly monotonous. I know that's probably not the right word but I don't know how to even describe the feeling. I just want every day to be new, unpredictable, adventurous idk. Now I'm sure I sound like a child.

Is there anyone that can relate or it's just me who's weird?

99,"TIP: If you're using Youtube to supplement your reading, try bookmarking your Youtube Account (NOT the Youtube Home) on your browser so you won't be distracted by a bunch of videos once you go to Youtube to type the concept you need to search there.","I often use Youtube to digress from reading a book or research paper because there's a particular abstract idea, mechanism, or experiment that I want to comprehend visually because the author did not elaborate it (usually because there's an assumption that the reader knows it already). To catch up with the discussion, I go to Youtube to search for the desired information. Twenty minutes later, however, I found myself watching cat videos or the newly uploaded videos of my favorite channels. At this point, I am going to ask myself ""Why am I watching this?"" or ""What was I needed to search again?""
